### Objection Handling Scripts

**Objection: "We already use Searchable"**
```
Perfect! Many of our customers use both. 

Searchable is excellent for daily monitoring—we actually recommend it 
for practitioner-level tracking.

AIDI provides the quarterly validation layer for strategic decisions:
• Board presentations (audit-grade benchmarks)
• Competitive intelligence (industry percentiles)
• Performance attribution (statistical validation)

Think of it like using a Fitbit daily and getting annual bloodwork 
for strategic health decisions. Both valuable, different purposes.

Would quarterly benchmark validation be useful for your strategic planning?
```

**Objection: "Too expensive compared to Searchable"**
```
You're absolutely right that Searchable is more affordable for daily 
monitoring. That's intentional—different purposes, different pricing.

Question: Would you base a $500K board investment or M&A decision on 
$299/month monitoring data? Or would you want audit-grade validation 
with industry benchmarks and statistical confidence first?

AIDI is priced for strategic intelligence, not daily monitoring:
• $2,500 for full competitive benchmark
• $5,000 for protected site access (M&A due diligence)
• $10,000 for enterprise package with consulting

When the decision matters, rigor matters. That's where AIDI fits.
```

**Objection: "Why can't we just use custom prompts?"**
```
Custom prompts are great for exploration! But for strategic benchmarking, 
they create three critical issues:

Issue 1: BRANDED BIAS
User: "best Nike shoes" ← Brand is IN the prompt!
Reality: Buyers search "best running shoes under $150"
Result: Artificially inflated scores (false positives)

Issue 2: INCOMPARABLE RESULTS
Brand A tests "premium headphones"
Brand B tests "affordable earbuds"
Result: Cannot compare these scores across brands!

Issue 3: NO REPRODUCIBILITY
Different users, different prompts, different results
Result: Can't track true improvements over time

AIDI's systematic framework solves all three:
→ Unbiased, unbranded queries
→ Every brand tested identically
→ Reproducible, comparable, defensible

That's why boards trust it.
```
