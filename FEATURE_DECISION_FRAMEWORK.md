## üéì Learning Framework

### When You See a Competitor Feature, Ask:

1. **"Why did they build this?"**
   - Example: Searchable built prompts for flexibility
   - Lesson: Users want control

2. **"Who is it for?"**
   - Example: Prompts for practitioners, not executives
   - Decision: Don't copy, adapt for our audience

3. **"What's the core value?"**
   - Example: Core = visibility into AI platforms
   - Adaptation: We do this with systematic tests

4. **"Can we do it better?"**
   - Example: Better = transparent methodology + benchmarks
   - Opportunity: Leaderboards, API, open source

5. **"What would a data scientist want?"**
   - Example: Not prompt builder, but API access
   - Build: Programmatic evaluation, not UI tools
