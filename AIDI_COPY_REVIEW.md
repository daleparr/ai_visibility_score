# AI Discoverability & Reporting: Copy Review & Recommendations

**Objective:** To review the copy on the evaluation page and its associated downloadable reports, ensuring the language is meaningful, useful, and easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 1. Evaluation Page (`/evaluate`) Analysis

The evaluation page serves as the primary interface for users to see their results. The current structure is strong, but the copy can be sharpened to create a more compelling narrative that guides the user from data to decision.

### Key Strengths:
- **Clear Structure:** The page flows logically from a high-level score to detailed breakdowns.
- **Visual Cues:** The use of color, icons, and progress bars is effective at drawing attention.
- **Tier-Specific Content:** The page successfully differentiates between `free` and `index-pro` features, creating a clear upsell path.

### Recommendations:

#### **Recommendation 1.1: Rename "Pillars" to "Core Business Areas"**
*   **Current:** "Pillar Breakdown" with names like "Infrastructure & Machine Readability."
*   **Problem:** The term "Pillar" is internal jargon. "Infrastructure" is too technical and doesn't immediately convey a business benefit.
*   **Recommendation:** Reframe these as core business outcomes.
    *   Change the section title from **Pillar Breakdown** to **How AI Sees Your Business: 3 Core Areas**.
    *   Rename the pillars:
        *   `Infrastructure & Machine Readability` → **Technical Foundation**: "Is your digital presence built for AI?"
        *   `Perception & Reputation` → **Brand Reputation**: "What does AI think about your brand?"
        *   `Commerce & Customer Experience` → **Customer Journey**: "Can AI help customers buy from you?"
*   **Benefit:** This grounds the metrics in concrete business questions that a CMO or CEO would ask.

#### **Recommendation 1.2: Elevate the "Executive Summary"**
*   **Current:** The summary presents the overall score and URL.
*   **Problem:** It's a bit dry and doesn't immediately tell the user *what the score means for their business*.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a dynamic, one-sentence summary that contextualizes the score. For example:
    *   **If score > 80:** "Congratulations! Your brand has a **strong** presence in AI-driven search, putting you ahead of the competition."
    *   **If score 60-79:** "Your brand is **visible** to AI, but key improvements will unlock greater reach and more accurate recommendations."
    *   **If score < 60:** "Your brand is at **risk of being invisible** in the age of AI search. This report outlines the critical steps to fix it."
*   **Benefit:** Instantly frames the report's importance and sets the tone for the user.

#### **Recommendation 1.3: Make "AI Models Analyzed" More Tangible**
*   **Current:** Lists models like "ChatGPT (GPT-4)", "Claude-3-Sonnet".
*   **Problem:** A non-technical user might not grasp the significance of testing across multiple models.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a simple, benefit-oriented sub-header:
    > "We check what your customers see, wherever they're searching."
*   **Benefit:** Connects the technical process (multi-model analysis) to a real-world user behavior (customers using different AI tools).

## 2. PDF "Technical Report" Analysis

This document is crucial as it's the tangible takeaway that gets shared internally. The current name "Technical Report" might limit its audience.

### Recommendations:

#### **Recommendation 2.1: Rename the Report to "AI Readiness Report"**
*   **Current:** "AI Visibility Technical Report"
*   **Problem:** The word "Technical" may cause non-technical stakeholders to dismiss it as "something for the IT team."
*   **Recommendation:** Rename the file and title to **"AI Readiness Report"**.
*   **Benefit:** "Readiness" is a strategic term that speaks to C-level concerns about future-proofing the business. It broadens the perceived audience and importance of the document.

#### **Recommendation 2.2: Add a "Who Is This Report For?" Section**
*   **Current:** The report dives straight into data.
*   **Problem:** It doesn't set the context for *why* different people in the organization should care.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a small introductory section at the top:
    > **Who Is This Report For?**
    > *   **For Marketers:** Understand how AI perceives your brand narrative and competitive positioning.
    > *   **For Web & E-commerce Teams:** Get a prioritized list of technical fixes to improve AI-driven traffic.
    > *   **For Executives:** Benchmark your AI readiness against competitors and measure ROI on digital initiatives.
*   **Benefit:** Immediately makes the report relevant to multiple departments, increasing its internal circulation and impact.

## 3. Implementation Guidance (`report-utils.ts`) Analysis

This file is the "so what?" behind the data, providing actionable steps. The content is good, but it can be framed more persuasively.

### Recommendations:

#### **Recommendation 3.1: Translate "Implementation Steps" into "Action Plans"**
*   **Current:** The function `getImplementationSteps` returns a list of technical-leaning tasks.
*   **Problem:** "Implementation" sounds like a heavy lift. The steps are tasks, not a plan.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   In the report, title this section **"Your Action Plan."**
    *   For each recommendation, add a "Business Impact" statement right beside the title, using the existing `getBusinessImpactForRecommendation` function.
    *   **Example:**
        > #### **Action Plan: Improve Your Competitive Differentiation**
        > **Business Impact:** Helps AI recommend you over competitors, potentially increasing referrals by 20-30%.
        > 1.  Research top 3 competitors' AI visibility.
        > 2.  Define 2-3 unique value propositions AI currently misses.
        > 3.  Update your "Why Choose Us" page with this language.
*   **Benefit:** This reframing connects the *actions* directly to the *outcomes*, making the proposed work feel less like a chore and more like a strategic initiative.

#### **Recommendation 3.2: Make "Before/After" Examples More Prominent**
*   **Current:** The powerful "before/after" examples from `getAIInteractionExample` are available but could be highlighted more.
*   **Problem:** Users might not realize the tangible difference their actions will make.
*   **Recommendation:** In the on-page report, create a dedicated, visually distinct component for this.
    *   **Headline:** "From Confused to Convinced: How This Fix Changes Your AI Conversations"
    *   **Before (in red/muted tones):** "I'm not sure how they compare to other brands."
    *   **After (in green/bright tones):** "They're a premium sustainable alternative to fast fashion, ideal for the conscious luxury shopper."
*   **Benefit:** This provides a powerful, emotional "aha!" moment that vividly demonstrates the value of making the recommended changes.

## Summary of High-Impact Changes

1.  **Rebrand the Reports:** Change "Technical Report" to **"AI Readiness Report"** to increase its strategic appeal.
2.  **Focus on Business Questions:** Reframe technical "Pillars" as **"Core Business Areas"** (e.g., "Brand Reputation," "Customer Journey").
3.  **Create an Action-Oriented Narrative:** Translate "Implementation Steps" into an **"Action Plan"** that explicitly links tasks to business impact.

By implementing these copy changes, the reports will become significantly more effective at communicating value, driving action, and resonating with the non-technical decision-makers who approve budgets and strategies.
