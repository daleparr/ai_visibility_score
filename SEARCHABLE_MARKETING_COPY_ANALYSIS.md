### "About AEO" Page:

```markdown
# What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing your 
digital presence for AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Claude, 
Perplexity, and others.

While traditional SEO focuses on ranking in Google's search results,
AEO focuses on appearing in AI-generated answers and recommendations.

## The AIDI Approach to AEO

Most AEO tools focus on tactical execution:
• Automated fixes
• Content generation
• Daily monitoring

AIDI focuses on strategic intelligence:
• Where do you rank vs competitors?
• Which AEO dimensions need improvement?
• What's the ROI of each optimization?
• Are your improvements working?

Think of it this way:
• Google Analytics = Measurement
• Google Ads = Execution
• AIDI = Analytics for AEO
• Searchable = Execution for AEO

Both are essential. Start with measurement.
