# CMS Simple Test Page

**Issue:** Complex CMS page has errors  
**Solution:** Ultra-simple test page created

---

## ðŸš€ Try This Instead

### **http://localhost:3000/admin/simple-test**

This page:
- âœ… No complex components
- âœ… Just tests if theme API works
- âœ… Shows current colors
- âœ… Lets you change and save colors

---

## âœ… What You Should See

1. **Page loads** with "CMS Simple Test" headline
2. **Shows current primary color** in a colored box
3. **Color picker** to change it
4. **Save button** that works
5. **Preview** of how button looks with new color

---

## ðŸ§ª Test

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/admin/simple-test
2. Change the color using the picker
3. Click "Save Color"
4. Should see "Color saved!" alert
5. Refresh page - new color should persist

**If this works:** âœ… CMS backend is fully functional!

Then we can add back the complex UI components one by one.
