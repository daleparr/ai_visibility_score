  premium_tier: userTier === 'enterprise',
  merchant_opt_in: userPreferences.deepAnalysis === true
}

const shouldUseBlending = (brand, crawlData, user) => {
  return blendingCriteria.low_ai_recognition(brand.aiScore) ||
         (blendingCriteria.rich_website_content(crawlData) && 
          blendingCriteria.premium_tier(user)) ||
         blendingCriteria.merchant_opt_in(user)
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
```typescript
const smartSamplingFlow = async (brand, user) => {
  // Always run standard analysis
  const baseScore = await standardLLMTest(brand)
  
  // Conditionally run blended analysis
  if (shouldUseBlending(brand, crawlData, user)) {
    const blendedScore = await blendedLLMTest(brand, crawlData)
    return combineScores(baseScore, blendedScore)
  }
  
  return baseScore
}
```
