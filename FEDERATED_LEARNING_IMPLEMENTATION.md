## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Evaluation → Data Anonymization → Federated Collection
                                            ↓
Industry Benchmarks ← Pattern Recognition ← Collective Analysis
                                            ↓
Personalized Insights ← ML Models ← Peer Comparison Engine
                                            ↓
Dashboard Display ← Tier Filtering ← Recommendation Engine
```
