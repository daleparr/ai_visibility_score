## ðŸ”´ What YOU Need to Do (15 minutes)

### STEP 1: Run the SQL Migration (10 minutes)

The easiest way is via **Neon SQL Editor**:

1. **Open Neon Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.neon.tech
   - Log in to your account
   - Select your AIDI project

2. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

3. **Load the Migration File:**
   - On your computer, open this file: `sql/cms-content-authoritative-tone-migration.sql`
   - Press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Cmd+A (Mac) to select ALL
   - Press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Cmd+C (Mac) to copy

4. **Run the Migration:**
   - Go back to Neon SQL Editor in your browser
   - Paste the SQL (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
   - Click the **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Wait 10-30 seconds for execution

5. **Verify Success:**
   - You should see green checkmarks or success messages
   - Run this verification query:
   ```sql
   SELECT slug, COUNT(*) as blocks 
   FROM cms_pages p 
   LEFT JOIN content_blocks cb ON cb.page_id = p.id 
   GROUP BY slug 
   ORDER BY slug;
   ```
   
   - You should see:
   ```
   homepage              | 15
   methodology           | 3-5
   faq                   | 2
   aidi-vs-monitoring-tools | 2-3
   reports-landing       | 4
   ```

**âœ… If you see those numbers, migration successful!**

### STEP 2: Test the New Pages (5 minutes)

Since we can't test locally without the database connection, let's deploy and test on production:

1. **Commit and Push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Implement CMS-driven authoritative copy with new methodology/FAQ pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Netlify Deploy:**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com
   - Wait for deploy to complete (~2-3 minutes)

3. **Test New Pages:**
   - Visit: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/methodology
   - Visit: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/faq
   - Visit: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/aidi-vs-monitoring-tools

4. **Test CMS Admin:**
   - Visit: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/admin/cms
   - Click "Page Content" â†’ "Homepage"
   - Try editing a block
   - Save changes
   - Refresh homepage to see changes
