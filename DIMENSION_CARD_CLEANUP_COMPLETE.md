### Index Pro & Enterprise Users
#### What They See (NEW):
- ✅ All free tier features
- ✅ **AI Conversation Examples** - dimension-specific before/after
- ✅ **Technical Details** - implementation-level information

#### Examples of Dynamic Content:

**Citation Strength Dimension:**
```
❌ Current AI Response:

✅ After Improvements:
"This brand has been featured in Vogue and Business Insider 
for their sustainable practices and quality."
```

**Geographic Visibility Dimension:**
```
❌ Current AI Response:

open until 8pm and has parking available."
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Interface
```typescript
interface UserFriendlyDimensionCardProps {
  dimension: {
    name: string
    score: number
    description: string
    pillar: string
  }
  isConversationalCopy?: boolean
  evidence?: any
  userTier?: 'free' | 'index-pro' | 'enterprise'  // ← NEW
}
```

### Conditional Rendering Pattern
```typescript
{/* Only show for paid tiers */}
{userTier !== 'free' && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Button onClick={() => setShowExample(!showExample)}>
      💬 See how this affects AI conversations
    </Button>
    {showExample && (
      <div>
        <p>❌ Current AI Response: "{aiExample.before}"</p>
        <p>✅ After Improvements: "{aiExample.after}"</p>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

### Usage in Pages
```typescript
<UserFriendlyDimensionCard
  dimension={dimension}
  userTier={tier}  // Pass from URL params or session
/>
```
