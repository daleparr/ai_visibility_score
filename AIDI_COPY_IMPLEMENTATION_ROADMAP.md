# AIDI Copy Implementation Roadmap
## From Consumer Marketing to Bloomberg Authority

**Created:** October 16, 2025  
**Framework:** AIDI Authoritative Accessibility  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge
Current copy is optimized for consumer conversion but undermines strategic positioning as the benchmark standard for AEO intelligence. The tone is marketing-heavy, lacks empirical evidence, and fails to acknowledge category leaders like Searchable.

### The Solution
Complete rewrite of homepage and key pages using the "AIDI Authoritative Accessibility" framework: Bloomberg's authority + Economist's clarity + Freakonomics' accessibility.

### The Investment
4 weeks of implementation via CMS-driven content management. No code changes requiredâ€”all updates through existing CMS infrastructure.

### The ROI
- Enable $2,500-10,000 enterprise pricing tiers
- Attract C-suite and data scientist buyers
- Support board presentation and M&A use cases
- Establish industry standard positioning
- Differentiate from monitoring tools

---

## Current State Assessment

### Framework Alignment Score: 18%
(Target: 90%+)

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Lead with Data, Land with Insight:** 2/10 â†’ Missing empirical evidence
2. **Statistical Rigor Communications:** 0/10 â†’ No confidence intervals or p-values
3. **Methodological Transparency:** 1/10 â†’ No published methodology
4. **Multi-Source Validation:** 0/10 â†’ No industry citations
5. **Industry Citations:** 0/10 â†’ No competitive context

**Consequences:**
- Enterprise buyers lack confidence in metrics
- Data scientists can't validate methodology
- Board presentations lack defendable rigor
- M&A use cases unsupported
- Positioned as monitoring tool (vs. benchmark standard)

## Conclusion

### The Opportunity
Current copy undermines AIDI's strategic positioning. By adopting the "AIDI Authoritative Accessibility" framework, we can:
- Enable enterprise pricing ($2,500-10,000)
- Attract C-suite and data scientist buyers
- Support board presentation and M&A use cases
- Establish industry standard positioning
- Build Bloomberg-grade institutional authority

### The Investment
4 weeks of CMS-driven implementation. No code changes required. Total cost: $3,650.

### The ROI
First 3 enterprise customers cover implementation cost. Lifetime value increase from consumer ($119) to enterprise ($10,000+) represents 84X improvement.

### The Risk
Without tone shift, enterprise adoption will stall despite product quality. Continuing with consumer marketing undermines strategic positioning.

### The Decision
All content is ready. CMS infrastructure exists. Team training materials prepared.

**Recommendation:** Approve for Week 1 implementation.

---

**Status:** âœ… Ready to Proceed  
**Framework Alignment Target:** 92%+  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks  
**Budget:** $3,650  
**ROI:** 2.7X (first Enterprise Package)

**Next Step:** Leadership approval + Day 1 kick-off
