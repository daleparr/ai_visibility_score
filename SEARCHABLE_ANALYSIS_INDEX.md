## 🏆 Key Findings Summary

### Searchable's Critical Weaknesses
1. **❌ Cannot crawl password-protected sites**
   - Pre-launch audits impossible
   - M&A due diligence incomplete
   - Staging environments inaccessible

2. **❌ No systematic benchmarking**
   - User-defined prompts = inconsistent
   - No industry percentiles
   - Impossible to compare brands/time

3. **❌ Branded query bias**
   - Users test "[their brand]" queries
   - Inflates scores artificially
   - Doesn't reflect real buyer behavior

4. **❌ Statistical invalidity**
   - Single-run testing (no averaging)
   - No confidence intervals
   - Cannot prove improvements

5. **❌ Black box methodology**
   - Not peer-reviewable
   - Cannot validate approach
   - No audit trail

### AIDI's Competitive Moats
1. **✅ Full-site deep crawl** (with credentials)
2. **✅ Industry benchmarking** (percentile rankings)
3. **✅ Bias-free testing** (unbranded queries)
4. **✅ Statistical rigor** (confidence intervals, p-values)
5. **✅ Peer-reviewable** (published methodology)

**Result:** Searchable = monitoring-grade. AIDI = audit-grade.
