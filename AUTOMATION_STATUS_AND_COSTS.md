# üîç Automation Status & Cost Analysis - October 15, 2025

## ‚ùå Critical Issue: Database Quota Exceeded

**Status**: Automation is attempting to run but failing due to Neon database quota limits.

---

## üìä What Actually Happened This Morning

### Configuration
From `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[functions."scheduled-leaderboard-queue"]
  schedule = "*/30 * * * *"  # Runs every 30 minutes, 24/7
```

### Batch Settings
From `netlify/functions/scheduled-leaderboard-queue.ts`:
```typescript
{
  batchSize: 5,        // Process 5 brands per run
  dailyLimit: 20,      // Maximum 20 evaluations per day
  retryAttempts: 3     // Retry failed evaluations 3 times
}
```

### Actual Execution Attempts
Based on the error logs:
```
12:09:19 PM: Attempted evaluation for crewclothing.co.uk
12:14:03 PM: Attempted evaluation for nike.com
```

**Result**: Both failed due to database quota exceeded error:
```
"Your project has exceeded the data transfer quota. 
Upgrade your plan to increase limits."
```

## üí∞ What the Costs WOULD Have Been

### If Automation Had Run Successfully

#### Per 30-Minute Run:
- **Brands Processed**: 5 brands
- **AI Models Used**: GPT-4o-mini (free tier default)
- **Queries per Brand**: ~12 dimension tests

#### API Call Breakdown Per Brand:
```
Schema Agent: 1 call (static analysis, no API)
Semantic Agent: 1 call (GPT-4o-mini)
Conversational Copy Agent: 1 call (GPT-4o-mini)
Knowledge Graph Agent: 1 call (GPT-4o-mini)
Brand Heritage Agent: 1 call (pattern matching, no API)
LLM Test Agent: 5-7 calls (GPT-4o-mini for multi-model testing)
```

**Total API Calls per Brand**: ~10 GPT-4o-mini calls

#### Cost Calculation:

**GPT-4o-mini Pricing** (OpenAI):
- Input: $0.15 / 1M tokens
- Output: $0.60 / 1M tokens

**Per Brand Evaluation**:
```
Estimated tokens per call:
- Input: ~500 tokens (prompt + context)
- Output: ~200 tokens (response)

10 calls √ó (500 input + 200 output) = 7,000 tokens total

Cost per brand:
Input: (10 √ó 500 tokens) / 1M √ó $0.15 = $0.00075
Output: (10 √ó 200 tokens) / 1M √ó $0.60 = $0.0012
Total: ~$0.002 per brand
```

**Per 30-Minute Run**:
- 5 brands √ó $0.002 = **$0.01** per run

**Daily Cost** (if running successfully):
- 48 runs per day (every 30 minutes)
- But daily limit is 20 evaluations
- Actual: 4 runs per day (5 brands each = 20 total)
- **Daily Cost**: 20 brands √ó $0.002 = **$0.04/day**

**Monthly Cost** (if running successfully):
- **$0.04 √ó 30 days = $1.20/month** in API costs

## üö® Why Automation Failed

### Root Cause: Neon Database Quota Exceeded

**Neon Free Tier Limits**:
- Data Transfer: **5 GB/month**
- Storage: **0.5 GB**
- Compute: **191.9 hours/month**

### What Consumed the Quota:

1. **Automated Leaderboard Runs**
   - Scheduled every 30 minutes since deployment
   - Each run attempts database queries
   - Even failed attempts count toward quota

2. **User Evaluation Attempts**
   - Every evaluation saves to database:
     - Evaluation records
     - Probe results
     - Agent outputs
     - HTML content (page_blobs)
     - Cache entries

3. **Cumulative Effect**:
   - Multiple evaluation attempts
   - Automated scheduler running 48√ó daily
   - Each attempt makes 5-10 database queries
   - **Estimated**: 200-500 MB+ transfer in past few days

---

## üìâ Database Transfer Usage Estimate

### Since Last Deploy (~3 days):

**Automated Scheduler**:
- 48 runs/day √ó 3 days = 144 run attempts
- Each attempt: 5-10 queries even if failed
- Estimated: 720-1,440 queries
- Transfer per query: ~50KB (user select, brand lookups)
- **Total**: ~35-70 MB from automation alone

**Manual Evaluations**:
- Estimated: 10-20 evaluation attempts
- Each evaluation: 50-100 queries
- Transfer per evaluation: ~5-10 MB
- **Total**: ~50-200 MB from evaluations

**Leaderboard Cache & Queries**:
- Cache updates, rankings calculations
- **Total**: ~100-200 MB

**TOTAL ESTIMATED USAGE**: **185-470 MB** in 3 days
- **Projected Monthly**: **1.8-4.7 GB** (within free tier)

**BUT**: If quota was already used before these deployments, this pushed it over the edge.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade Neon Database (Recommended)
**Cost**: $19/month (Neon Pro)
**Benefits**:
- 200 GB/month data transfer (40√ó increase)
- 10 GB storage (20√ó increase)
- Priority support
- **SOLVES ISSUE IMMEDIATELY**

**Action**:
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Upgrade to "Pro" plan
4. Automation resumes automatically

---

### Option 2: Reduce Automation Frequency (Temporary)
**Cost**: $0
**Tradeoff**: Less fresh data

**Change `netlify.toml`**:
```toml
# From this (every 30 minutes):
[functions."scheduled-leaderboard-queue"]
  schedule = "*/30 * * * *"

# To this (daily at 2 AM):
[functions."scheduled-leaderboard-queue"]
  schedule = "0 2 * * *"
```

**Impact**: Reduces from 48 runs/day to 1 run/day
**Savings**: 97.9% reduction in automation queries

---

### Option 3: Switch to Different Database
**Cost**: $0-15/month
**Effort**: Medium

**Options**:
1. **Supabase** (Free tier: 8 GB transfer)
2. **PlanetScale** (Free tier: 10 GB transfer)
3. **Vercel Postgres** (Free tier: 256 MB storage, but different pricing model)

---

### Option 4: Add Query Caching Layer
**Cost**: $0
**Effort**: High

Implement Redis caching to reduce database hits:
- Cache user lookups (guest user)
- Cache brand lookups
- Cache recent evaluations
- **Potential**: 60-80% reduction in database queries

---

## üìä Actual vs. Expected Behavior

### What SHOULD Have Happened:
```
2:00 AM UTC: Daily evaluation runs
  ‚Üì
Process 5 brands from queue
  ‚Üì
Each brand gets full ADI evaluation
  ‚Üì
Results cached in leaderboard_cache
  ‚Üì
20 brands evaluated daily (within quota)
```

### What ACTUALLY Happened:
```
Every 30 minutes: Scheduler triggered
  ‚Üì
Attempt to query database for brands
  ‚Üì
Database query fails: Quota exceeded
  ‚Üì
Evaluation aborts before any AI calls
  ‚Üì
NO EVALUATIONS COMPLETED
NO API COSTS INCURRED
```

---

## üí° Key Findings

### 1. **Zero AI API Costs This Morning** ‚úÖ
The automation **failed before making any AI API calls**.

**Evidence**:
```
ERROR: Failed to ensure guest user exists
‚Üí Database query failed
‚Üí Evaluation aborted
‚Üí No AI models called
‚Üí $0 in API costs
```

### 2. **Database Quota is the Blocker** ‚ùå
Every evaluation attempt hits the database first (user lookup, brand lookup).

**The Flow**:
```
1. scheduled-leaderboard-queue runs (every 30 min)
2. Query database for brands in queue
3. ‚ùå FAILS: Quota exceeded
4. Never reaches AI API calls
```

### 3. **Automation Config is Too Aggressive** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Running every 30 minutes is unnecessary:
- **Current**: 48 potential runs/day
- **Needed**: 1-2 runs/day
- **Waste**: 47 unnecessary scheduler triggers hitting quota

---

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 10 Minutes):

**Option A: Upgrade Neon** ($19/month)
```bash
# Most reliable solution
# Go to: https://console.neon.tech
# Click: Upgrade to Pro
# Done: Automation resumes automatically
```

**Option B: Reduce Schedule** (Free)
```bash
# Edit netlify.toml
[functions."scheduled-leaderboard-queue"]
  schedule = "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM only

# Commit and push
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "Reduce automation to daily instead of every 30 min"
git push
```

---

### Short-term (This Week):

1. **Add Query Monitoring**
   - Track actual DB transfer usage
   - Alert when approaching limits
   - Optimize expensive queries

2. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache guest user (reduces 48 queries/day)
   - Cache brand lookups (reduces 240 queries/day)
   - Use in-memory cache for frequent reads

3. **Optimize Batch Size**
   - Reduce from 5 brands to 3 brands per run
   - Still hit daily limit but with less DB overhead

## üîç Morning Automation Analysis

### Schedule Reality:
- **Intended**: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Actual Config**: Every 30 minutes (!!)
- **Why**: Schedule configured as `*/30 * * * *` instead of `0 2 * * *`

### What Ran:
| Time | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 12:09:19 PM | Evaluation attempt (crewclothing.co.uk) | Failed - DB quota |
| 12:14:03 PM | Evaluation attempt (nike.com) | Failed - DB quota |

These were **user-triggered evaluations**, not scheduled automation.

### What Should Have Run:
- **2:00 AM UTC** (3:00 AM BST): Daily automation
- **Status**: Would have failed due to DB quota

### API Calls Made:
- **Zero** - All failures happened before AI API calls
- **Cost**: $0.00

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

### This Morning's Automation:
‚úÖ **Build**: Successful  
‚ùå **Database**: Quota exceeded  
‚ùå **Evaluations**: 0 completed  
üí∞ **API Costs**: $0.00 (failed before API calls)  
üìä **Data Generated**: None  

### Root Cause:
1. **Aggressive schedule**: Every 30 min instead of daily
2. **Quota exhausted**: Database transfer limit hit
3. **No fallback**: No error handling for quota limits

### Immediate Fix Needed:
**Either**:
- Upgrade Neon to Pro ($19/month) ‚Üê Recommended
- **OR** change schedule to daily only (free)

---

## üìã Action Items

**Choose ONE**:

### Path A: Pay to Scale (Recommended)
```
1. Upgrade Neon to Pro ($19/month)
2. Automation resumes automatically
3. Handle ~200 evaluations/month comfortably
4. Monitor usage via Neon dashboard
```

### Path B: Optimize for Free Tier
```
1. Change schedule to daily (save 95% DB queries)
2. Add caching layer for user/brand lookups
3. Reduce batch size to 3 brands
4. Stay within free tier limits
```

Would you like me to implement Path B (optimize for free tier) now?
