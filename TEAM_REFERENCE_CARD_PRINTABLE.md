# AIDI Team Reference Card
## Quick Reference - Print & Keep at Desk

**Version:** 1.0 (Locked October 15, 2025)  
**Format:** One-page printable  
**Purpose:** Consistent positioning across all communications

## 🎯 OUR POSITIONING (Memorize This)

### The Tagline
> **"The Benchmark Standard for AEO Intelligence"**

### The One-Liner
> "While monitoring tools provide quick feedback, AIDI delivers the systematic benchmarking enterprises need for strategic decisions."

### The 30-Second Pitch
> "Searchable and other tools excel at daily practitioner monitoring. AIDI provides audit-grade benchmarking for executives: systematic framework, industry percentiles, statistical validation, peer-reviewed methodology. When the decision matters—board presentations, M&A due diligence, strategic planning—you need audit-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade alerts."

---

## 🤝 SEARCHABLE RELATIONSHIP (Critical Rules)

### ✅ ALWAYS Say:
- "Grateful to category leaders like Searchable..."
- "Searchable excels at daily monitoring..."
- "Both valuable, serve different needs..."
- "Use Searchable for tactics, AIDI for strategy..."

### ❌ NEVER Say:
- "Searchable is wrong"
- "We're better than Searchable"
- "Don't use Searchable"
- "Searchable's problems"

### 🎯 Standard Response:
> "Searchable is excellent for daily monitoring. Many of our customers use both: Searchable for practitioner-level tracking, AIDI for quarterly executive validation. Complementary tools, different purposes."

## 🏆 OUR 5 COMPETITIVE MOATS

1. **Systematic Benchmarking** - Industry percentiles (not isolated scores)
2. **Statistical Validation** - 95% CI, p-values (not single-run guesses)
3. **Bias-Free Testing** - Unbranded queries (not branded prompts)
4. **Protected Site Access** - Human-assisted deep audit (not surface only)
5. **Peer-Reviewable** - Published methodology (not black box)

**Searchable cannot replicate any of these.**

## 💬 OBJECTION HANDLING (Quick Scripts)

### "We already use Searchable"
> "Perfect! Many customers use both. Searchable for daily monitoring, AIDI for quarterly validation. Like Fitbit + annual bloodwork. Both valuable, different purposes."

### "Too expensive vs Searchable"
> "Would you base a $500K board investment on $299/month monitoring data? Or audit-grade benchmarks? Different purposes, different pricing."

### "Why not just custom prompts?"
> "Custom prompts create branded bias ('best Nike shoes' vs 'best running shoes'). AIDI uses unbranded queries = true competitiveness, not false positives."

### "Can you crawl our protected site?"
> "Yes—human-assisted deep audit. Provide credentials, our data scientists analyze complete site including staging and gated content. $5K Protected Site Audit."
