# AIDI Brand Migration Strategy
## Strategic Brand Consolidation Plan

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive migration from "AI Visibility Score" to the **AIDI (AI Discoverability Index)** framework. This strategic consolidation addresses critical brand dilution issues and positions AIDI as the definitive standard for AI discoverability measurement.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Rationale

### Current Brand Dilution Problems
- **Brand Confusion (9/10 risk)**: Users don't understand the relationship between "AI Visibility Score" and "AIDI"
- **Marketing Dilution**: Splitting focus across two brands reduces memorability and authority
- **Competitive Weakness**: Generic "AI Visibility Score" is easily copied; "AIDI Index" is defensible
- **Premium Positioning Loss**: "Score" sounds free/basic; "Index" implies sophisticated benchmark

### AIDI Strategic Advantages
| Factor | AIDI Index | AI Visibility Score |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Market Differentiation | 9/10 | 4/10 |
| Thought Leadership | 9/10 | 3/10 |
| Competitive Defensibility | 9/10 | 3/10 |
| Executive Appeal | 8/10 | 6/10 |
| Premium Positioning | 9/10 | 5/10 |
