## 🏆 Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Searchable's Two Critical Gaps
**Gap #1:** Cannot crawl password-protected sites (access limitation)  
**Gap #2:** User-defined prompts lack systematic benchmarking (methodological weakness)

**Your advantage:** Full-site access + systematic framework = audit-grade rigor

---

### 2. They're Category Creators, You're Benchmark Standard
**Don't compete.** Let them educate the market about AEO.  
**You follow** as the measurement standard enterprises require.

**Analogy:**
- Searchable = FitBit (consumer monitoring)
- AIDI = Medical lab test (clinical diagnosis)

---

### 3. Complementary Positioning Wins
**Strategy:** "Use both for mature programs"
- Searchable: Daily practitioner monitoring
- AIDI: Quarterly strategic validation

**Benefit:** No hostile competition, partnership potential, premium pricing justified

---

## 🚀 Your Locked Positioning

### Tagline
> "The Benchmark Standard for AEO Intelligence"

### Core Message
```
Searchable monitors daily tactics.
AIDI validates quarterly strategy.

While monitoring tools provide quick feedback with user-defined tests,
AIDI delivers audit-grade intelligence with scientific rigor:

✓ Systematic benchmarking (industry percentiles)
✓ Statistical validation (95% CI, p-values)
✓ Bias-free methodology (unbranded queries)
✓ Protected site access (human-assisted deep audit)
✓ Peer-reviewable results (published framework)
```

---

## 💰 Premium Pricing Strategy

**Searchable:** $99-999/mo (monitoring)  
**AIDI:** $2,500-10,000 (strategic audits)

**Justified by:**
- Different buyer (C-suite vs practitioner)
- Different use case (strategic vs tactical)
- Different rigor (audit-grade vs monitoring-grade)
