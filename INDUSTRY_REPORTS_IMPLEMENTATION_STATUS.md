## 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Next Steps)

### 10. Results Page Integration (Current Priority)
- [x] CompetitiveBenchmark component created

## 🎯 Implementation Plan - Results Page

### What Needs to be Done

**File**: `src/app/evaluate/page.tsx` (2187 lines)

**Changes Needed**:

1. **Fetch sector/competitor data after evaluation completes**
   ```typescript
   // After evaluation completes, check if sector was saved
   const sectorData = await fetch(`/api/evaluations/set-sector?evaluationId=${evalId}`)
   const { sectorId, sectorName, sectorSlug, competitors } = await sectorData.json()
   ```

2. **Fetch industry report data** (if sector exists)
   ```typescript
   const benchmark = await getCompetitiveBenchmark(
     userDomain,
     sectorId,
     competitors,
     new Date()
   )
   ```

3. **Add CompetitiveBenchmark component to results layout**
   ```typescript
   {sectorId && (
     <CompetitiveBenchmark
       tier={tier}
       sectorName={sectorName}
       sectorSlug={sectorSlug}
       userRank={benchmark.userRank}
       totalBrands={78}
       userMentionShare={benchmark.userMentionShare}
       sectorAverage={benchmark.sectorAverage}
       competitors={benchmark.competitorRanks}
       userScore={evaluationData.overallScore}
     />
   )}
   ```

4. **Gate probe results panel** by tier
   ```typescript
   {tier !== 'free' ? (
     <ProbeResultsPanel data={probeResults} />
   ) : (
     <LockedProbeResults />
   )}
   ```
