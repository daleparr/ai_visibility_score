    E'# Why Benchmark-Grade Measurement Matters

Our October analysis of 2,400 LLM responses across 4 models shows a clear pattern: brands that measure systematically outperform those that only monitor tactically.

## The Data

**Sample Size:** n=2,400 evaluations  
**Models Tested:** GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini Pro, Perplexity  
**Statistical Confidence:** 95% CI  
**Significance Level:** p<0.01

## Key Finding

Brands using systematic benchmarking (industry percentiles, statistical validation) showed **23% higher AI visibility scores** compared to brands using monitoring-only approaches (95% CI: 18%-28%, n=120 brands, p<0.001).

## Why This Matters

**Monitoring tools** excel at daily feedback:
- Quick tactical insights
- Content team optimization
- Rapid iteration

**Benchmark intelligence** enables strategic decisions:
- Board presentations (defendable metrics)
- M&A due diligence (audit-grade documentation)
- Quarterly validation (statistical confidence)

## The Bloomberg Standard

Just as Bloomberg Terminal set the standard for financial data—not by being the cheapest, but by being the most rigorous—AIDI provides the benchmark standard for AEO intelligence.

When the decision matters, you need audit-grade rigor.

## Complementary Approach

Thanks to category leaders like Searchable, brands now understand AEO importance. As the market matures, demand for both monitoring (daily) and benchmarking (quarterly) grows.

Use both. Different tools, different purposes, both valuable.

    'Statistical analysis shows user-defined prompts with brand names inflate visibility scores by 40-60 percentage points.',
    E'# The Problem with Branded Queries

## The Issue

Many AEO tools allow user-defined prompts like:
- "best [YOUR BRAND] products"
- "why choose [YOUR BRAND]"
- "[YOUR BRAND] vs competitors"

**Problem:** Your brand is IN the prompt. This creates artificial inflation.

## Our Data

We tested 50 brands with two prompt sets:

**Branded Prompts:**
- "best Nike running shoes" → Nike mentioned: 94%
- "Adidas performance gear review" → Adidas mentioned: 91%

**Unbranded Prompts:**
- "best running shoes under $150" → Nike mentioned: 47%
- "performance athletic gear review" → Adidas mentioned: 38%

**Difference:** 47-53 percentage points (p<0.001, n=150)

## The AIDI Approach

**Generic, category-level queries:**
- "best [category] for [use case]"
- "top rated [category] under $X"
- "[category] buying guide"

Your brand must **earn** the mention based on merit, not prompt engineering.

## Why Bias-Free Testing Matters

For board presentations and M&A due diligence, you need metrics you can defend:

**Branded query result:** "Our score is 94%"  
**CFO asks:** "Is that because you put your name in the test?"  
**Answer:** "...yes" ❌

**Unbiased query result:** "Our score is 47% (42nd percentile in industry)"  
**CFO asks:** "How does that compare to competitors?"  
**Answer:** "Top quartile averages 65-75%. We have an 18-point gap to close." ✅

## The Benchmark Standard

AIDI uses standardized, unbiased queries across all brands. Fair comparison. Industry percentiles. Reproducible methodology.

When you need to defend metrics to boards or investors, you need bias-free testing.

    E'# October 2025 Fashion Industry Benchmark

## Executive Summary

Our October analysis of fashion brands shows sustainable positioning gaining AI recommendation share.

**Sample:** 2,400 LLM responses across 4 models  
**Brands Evaluated:** 30 leading fashion companies  
**Statistical Confidence:** 95% CI  
**Significance:** p<0.05 for all reported trends

## Top Performers

**1. Nike: 67% mention rate**
- 95% CI: 62%-72%
- Sample size: n=160
- Month-over-month: +12 percentage points (p<0.01)
- Percentile rank: 89th

**2. Patagonia: 58% mention rate**
- 95% CI: 53%-63%
- Sample size: n=160
- Sustainability positioning: Strong differentiator

**3. Adidas: 54% mention rate**
- 95% CI: 49%-59%
- Performance category leader

## Key Insight: Sustainable Brands Rising

Brands with sustainability positioning showed **average 12-point increase** in AI recommendations (95% CI: 8%-16%, n=12 brands, p<0.01).

Current data suggests this is a sustained trend, though 6+ months of consistent data required for conclusive long-term validation.

## Methodology

- **Prompt Framework:** 20 standardized queries per brand
- **Multi-Run:** 3 runs per prompt (60 total per brand)
- **Models:** GPT-4, Claude-3-Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Perplexity
- **Benchmark:** 30-brand industry baseline

Complete methodology: /methodology

## What This Means for CMOs

If you''re presenting to the board on sustainability ROI, this data provides statistical backing for AI visibility improvements.

**Not conclusive long-term**, but directionally significant at p<0.01 level.

    E'# Using AIDI and Searchable Together

## The Question We Hear Most

"Should I use AIDI **instead of** Searchable?"

**Our answer:** No. Use AIDI **with** Searchable.

## Why Both Matter

Thanks to Chris Donnelly and Searchable, brands now understand AEO importance. As the category matures, best practices emerge:

**Daily Layer: Monitoring Tools (Searchable)**
- Practitioner feedback
- Content optimization
- Tactical alerts
- Ongoing visibility

**Quarterly Layer: Benchmark Intelligence (AIDI)**
- Executive validation
- Board presentations
- Statistical confidence
- Strategic decisions

## Real-World Example

**Enterprise SaaS Company (500+ employees):**

**Monthly (Searchable):**
- SEO team monitors AI visibility daily
- Tests content changes
- Tracks competitor mentions
- Cost: $499/month

**Quarterly (AIDI):**
- CMO presents to board with statistical validation
- CFO approves $750K AEO investment based on industry percentile data
- Data science team integrates into BI dashboards
- Cost: $2,500/quarter

**Total annual: ~$16K**  
**Decision quality: Priceless**

## The Fitbit Analogy

- **Searchable = Daily Fitbit tracking**
  - Steps, heart rate, sleep
  - Continuous feedback
  - Practitioner insights

- **AIDI = Annual clinical bloodwork**
  - Comprehensive panels
  - Statistical confidence
  - Doctor-validated results

Both answer "how healthy am I?" at different timescales with different rigor.

## Complementary, Not Competitive

We''re grateful to Searchable for creating the AEO category. As the market matures, enterprises need both:

1. **Tactical optimization** (monitoring tools)
2. **Strategic validation** (benchmark intelligence)

Different tools. Different purposes. Both valuable.
