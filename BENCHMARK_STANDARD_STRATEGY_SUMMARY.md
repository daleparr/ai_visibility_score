## 🎯 The Core Strategy (One Paragraph)

We are NOT competing with Searchable. We acknowledge them as the AEO category creator and position AIDI as the complementary benchmark standard. Searchable leads on market education and practitioner monitoring (their reach, funding, and momentum prepare the market). AIDI leads on scientific rigor and strategic validation (systematic benchmarking, statistical validation, peer-reviewable methodology). They serve different buyers, different needs, different use cases—making us complementary, not competitive. This positioning is superior because it avoids direct competition with a well-funded player while claiming the premium "audit-grade" category they cannot serve.

## 📊 The Master Comparison

| Dimension | Searchable<br>(Monitoring-Grade) | AIDI<br>(Audit-Grade) | Winner |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Role** | Category creator | Benchmark standard | Different roles |
| **Target User** | Practitioners | C-suite / Data scientists | Different buyers |
| **Methodology** | User-defined prompts | Systematic framework | ✅ AIDI (reproducible) |
| **Benchmarking** | None | Industry percentiles | ✅ AIDI (competitive context) |
| **Site Access** | Public only | Protected sites via human-assisted | ✅ AIDI (M&A capability) |
| **Statistical Rigor** | Single runs | Multi-run + 95% CI | ✅ AIDI (defensible) |
| **Bias Control** | Uncontrolled | Systematic elimination | ✅ AIDI (objective) |
| **Peer Review** | Black box | Published methodology | ✅ AIDI (auditable) |
| **Use Case** | Daily monitoring | Quarterly strategy | Different needs |
| **Pricing** | $99-999/mo | $2,500-10,000/audit | Premium justified |

**Verdict:** Complementary tools serving different enterprise needs.

## 💬 The Locked Positioning Statement

**Use this EXACT language consistently:**

```
Searchable lets users run custom, often brand-focused prompts to check 
AI visibility, but this approach is methodologically weak. Results depend 
on who asks, what they ask, and when—not on how real consumers discover 
brands.

Branded queries artificially inflate visibility, creating a false sense 
of AI discoverability (false positives). Worse, Searchable cannot truly 
crawl password-protected, pre-launch, or gated content—it relies on 
surface scraping or cached data. For protected sites, AI results may be 
outdated or entirely hallucinated by LLMs, not based on your real content. 
This makes Searchable's monitoring fast but fundamentally unreliable for 
enterprise or board-level trust.

AIDI solves these issues with audit-grade rigor:

✓ Standardized, bias-controlled tests (not user-defined prompts)
✓ Industry benchmarking (not isolated scores)  
✓ Statistical validation (not single-run guesses)

✓ HUMAN-ASSISTED DEEP CRAWL for protected sites—
  provide temporary credentials and our data scientists analyze your 
  complete site including staging environments, member portals, and 
  pre-launch content.

This delivers results executives can actually rely on for strategic 
decisions: board presentations, M&A due diligence, and pre-launch planning.

## 🏆 Your Five Competitive Moats

### 1. Systematic Benchmarking
**What:** Every brand tested with identical methodology  
**Why Searchable can't:** User-defined prompts = no standard  
**Business impact:** Industry percentiles, competitive intelligence

### 2. Statistical Validation
**What:** Multi-run averaging with 95% confidence intervals  
**Why Searchable can't:** Single-run testing, no statistical framework  
**Business impact:** Prove improvements, performance attribution

### 3. Bias-Free Testing
**What:** Unbranded, category-generic queries only  
**Why Searchable can't:** Users create branded prompts (inflates scores)  
**Business impact:** True competitiveness, not false positives

### 4. Protected Site Access
**What:** Human-assisted deep audit with credentials  
**Why Searchable can't:** Automated crawler can't authenticate  
**Business impact:** Pre-launch evaluation, M&A due diligence

### 5. Peer-Reviewable Methodology
**What:** Published framework, academic validation  
**Why Searchable can't:** Proprietary black box approach  
**Business impact:** Board trust, regulatory compliance

## 🤝 Searchable Relationship Protocol

### ALWAYS Say:
- ✅ "Grateful to category leaders like Searchable..."
- ✅ "Searchable excels at daily monitoring..."
- ✅ "Both are valuable, serve different needs..."
- ✅ "Use Searchable for tactics, AIDI for strategy..."

### NEVER Say:
- ❌ "Searchable is wrong"
- ❌ "We're better than Searchable"
- ❌ "Don't use Searchable"
- ❌ "Searchable's problems"

### Public Stance:
```
"We're grateful to Chris Donnelly and Searchable for their leadership 
in creating the AEO category. Their reach, funding, and momentum are 
preparing the market and educating brands.

AIDI follows as the benchmark standard—providing the systematic 
measurement that strategic decisions require.

We see these as complementary roles: Searchable for category creation 
and daily monitoring, AIDI for benchmark standards and strategic validation."
