## 📍 **Where to Find It**

**URL Pattern:** `/evaluate?url={brand-url}&tier=index-pro` or `tier=enterprise`

**Location in Report:** 
- After the "AI Models Analyzed" section
- Before the "AIDI Certification" section
- Only visible for Index-Pro and Enterprise tiers

---

## 🔍 **Data Source**

Probe results come from:
- **Database Table**: `production.backend_agent_executions`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/evaluation/{id}/report`
- **Field**: `agentResults` array in report response

Each agent execution stores:
```json
{
  "agentName": "llm_test_agent",
  "executionTime": 10245,
  "status": "completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "testName": "Brand Recognition",
      "status": "passed",
      "score": 85,
      "response": "Nike is a leading athletic apparel and footwear brand...",
      "confidence": 95
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "testsRun": 3,
    "brandName": "Nike",
    "apiProvider": "openai",
    "placeholder": false,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-10T12:20:45.288Z"
  }
}
```
