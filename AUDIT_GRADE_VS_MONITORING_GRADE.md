## 💬 Sales Messaging Scripts

### For C-Suite Executives

**Opening Question:**
> "Would you present self-reported, user-generated metrics to your board? Or would you want audit-grade benchmarks with statistical confidence intervals?"

**Key Points:**
```
AIDI provides the rigor C-suite demands:

1. Industry Percentiles (not subjective scores)
   - "You're in the 47th percentile for your category"
   - vs "You scored 67/100" (meaningless without context)

2. Statistical Validation (not single-run guesses)
   - "Score improved +12 points (p < 0.05, statistically significant)"
   - vs "Your score went up" (could be random variance)

3. Competitive Benchmarking (not isolated metrics)
   - "You trail category leader by 18 points across 3 dimensions"
   - vs "You should improve X" (no competitive context)

4. Reproducible Methodology (not black box)
   - "Our framework is published and peer-reviewed"
   - vs "Trust our algorithm" (cannot validate)
```

### For Data Scientists

**Opening Question:**
> "Can you replicate their results? Control for bias? Export raw data? Validate their statistical claims?"

**Key Points:**
```
AIDI is built by data scientists, for data scientists:

1. Locked Test Framework
   - Same prompts every time
   - Version-controlled models
   - Temperature = 0 (reproducible)
   - 3-run averaging (n=3 minimum)

2. Bias Elimination Protocols
   - No branded queries in baseline
   - Category-generic phrasing
   - Geographic normalization
   - Temporal controls

3. Statistical Rigor
   - Confidence intervals (95% CI)
   - Significance testing (p-values)
   - Effect size reporting (Cohen's d)
   - Outlier detection (IQR method)

4. Full Data Access
   - API for all evaluation data
   - Raw prompt/response logs
   - Export to CSV/JSON
   - BI tool integration (Tableau, PowerBI)
```

### For Procurement/Legal

**Opening Question:**
> "Can you audit their methodology? Validate benchmarks? Compare vendors objectively? Defend this investment to finance?"

**Key Points:**
```
AIDI provides the audit trail enterprises require:

1. Documented Methodology
   - Published evaluation framework
   - Peer-reviewed protocols
   - Version-controlled tests
   - No proprietary black boxes

2. Third-Party Validated
   - Academic partnerships
   - Industry working groups
   - Standards compliance (pending)
   - External auditor access

3. Comparable Metrics
   - Industry-standard baselines
   - Cross-vendor evaluation
   - Objective scoring criteria
   - Fair comparison framework

4. Contract Protections
   - SLA guarantees
   - Data ownership clarity
   - Audit rights
   - Methodology lock-ins
```

## 📈 ROI Justification Calculator

### Scenario: Board Presentation Decision

**Option A: Searchable (Monitoring-Grade)**
```
Monthly cost: $299
Board asks: "How do we compare to competitors?"
Your answer: "I'm not sure—different people test different things"
Board confidence: Low
Budget approval: Denied
```

**Option B: AIDI (Audit-Grade)**
```
Quarterly cost: $2,500
Board asks: "How do we compare to competitors?"
Your answer: "We're in the 42nd percentile. Top quartile requires +18 pts improvement in 3 dimensions."
Board confidence: High
Budget approval: $500K strategic initiative approved
```

**ROI:** $500K budget approved / $2.5K investment = **20,000% ROI**

---

### Scenario: Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence

**Option A: Searchable (Cannot Access)**
```
Target: Shopify Plus store (password-protected)
Searchable: "Cannot crawl protected sites"
Due diligence: Incomplete
Decision: Pass on deal or overpay
```

**Option B: AIDI (Full Access)**
```
Target: Shopify Plus store (password-protected)
AIDI: Full deep crawl with credentials
Finding: Critical AEO gaps worth $2M in valuation
Decision: Renegotiate 15% lower price
```

**ROI:** $2M saved / $10K audit = **20,000% ROI**

---

### Scenario: Performance Attribution

**Option A: Searchable (Inconsistent Methodology)**
```
Before: Custom prompt set A
After: Custom prompt set B (user changed them)
Result: "Score improved 10 points"
CFO: "Can you prove this wasn't random variance?"
You: "No..."
Program renewal: Denied
```

**Option B: AIDI (Locked Framework)**
```
Before: Standardized test framework
After: Same test framework (locked)
Result: "+12 points (p=0.03, statistically significant)"
CFO: "Statistical confidence?"
You: "95% CI: +8 to +16 points"
Program renewal: Approved ($200K annual)
```

**ROI:** $200K program justified / $7.5K investment = **2,567% ROI**

## 🔥 Competitive Battle Cards

### When Prospect Says: "We're already using Searchable"

**Response:**
> "Excellent! Searchable is great for daily monitoring. Think of AIDI as your quarterly validation layer. While Searchable gives you quick feedback, AIDI provides the audit-grade benchmarking you need for strategic decisions.
>
> Many of our customers use both:
> - **Searchable:** Daily practitioner monitoring (What's changing?)
> - **AIDI:** Quarterly strategic assessment (Where do we stand vs competitors?)
>
> You wouldn't replace your Fitbit with a medical lab test—you use both for different purposes."

### When Prospect Says: "Searchable is cheaper"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, and that makes sense for daily monitoring. But consider:
>
> **Question:** Would you base a $500K board investment on $299/month monitoring data? Or would you want audit-grade validation first?
>
> **Analogy:** It's like hiring:
> - **Searchable ($299/mo):** Junior analyst providing daily updates
> - **AIDI ($2.5K quarterly):** McKinsey consultant providing strategic audit
>
> Both have value, but when the decision is strategic, you need strategic rigor."

### When Prospect Says: "What's wrong with user-defined prompts?"

**Response:**
> "Nothing—for learning and exploration! But for benchmarking and strategic decisions, they create three problems:
>
> **Problem 1: Branded Bias**
> User prompt: 'best Nike shoes' ← Brand is IN the prompt!
> Real buyer: 'best running shoes under $150' ← Brand must earn mention
>
> **Problem 2: Incomparable Results**
> Your test: 'premium headphones'
> Competitor test: 'affordable earbuds'
> Cannot compare these scores!
>
> **Problem 3: Confirmation Bias**
> Users naturally test queries they expect to rank well on.
> Real buyers search very differently.
>
> **AIDI's Solution:** Every brand tested identically. Fair comparison, reproducible results, unbiased benchmarks."
