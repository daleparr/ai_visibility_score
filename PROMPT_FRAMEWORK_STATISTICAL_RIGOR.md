# Statistical Rigor Framework - Industry Reports

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your framework for **audit-grade, statistically rigorous** industry reports has been fully implemented.

---

## 🔬 Core Framework: 5×4 = 20 Prompts Per Sector

### Structure
- **5 Categories** (Discovery, Comparative, Problem-Solution, Trend, Trust)
- **4 Prompts per category** (systematically covers all buyer journey stages)
- **= 20 total prompts** per sector
- **× 4 models** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- **× 2 runs** (statistical stability without overspending)
- **= 160 API calls per sector/month**

### Cost Efficiency
- **Your Framework**: 160 calls × £0.50 = **£80/sector/month**
- **Old Approach**: 360 calls × £0.50 = **£180/sector/month**
- **Savings**: £100/sector = **£1,200/year per sector**

At 11 sectors: **£13,200/year savings** while improving quality! 💰

## 📊 Statistical Validity Features

### 1. Locked Variable Dictionaries ✅

**Implemented in**: `src/lib/industry-reports/sector-dictionaries.ts`

Each sector has **immutable** term definitions:

```typescript
fashion: {
  SECTOR_CATEGORY: ['sustainable fashion brands', ...], // NEVER changes
  SPECIFIC_USE_CASE: ['work clothes', ...],
  COMMON_PROBLEM: ['finding professional attire', ...],
  QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES: ['durability', ...],
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Month 1 and Month 12 are truly comparable
- No linguistic drift over time
- Statistical tests are valid
- Can say "p < 0.05" with confidence

### 2. Version Control System ✅

**Implemented in**: `src/lib/industry-reports/prompt-framework.ts`

Every prompt has:
- Unique ID: `DISC_001_fashion_v1.0`
- Version number: `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.
- Lock date: When this version was finalized
- Change log: What changed between versions

**Versioning Rules**:
1. ✅ Prompts locked for entire month
2. ✅ Can update between months (v1.0 → v1.1)
3. ✅ Old versions archived for comparison
4. ✅ Reports tagged with prompt version used

### 3. Statistical Significance Testing ✅

**Implemented**: `calculateStatisticalSignificance()` function

For every month-over-month change, calculate:

```typescript
{
  currentMonth: 67%,
  previousMonth: 59%,
  change: +8 percentage points,
  confidenceInterval: { lower: 4.2%, upper: 11.8% },
  pValue: 0.023, // p < 0.05
  cohensD: 0.41, // Moderate effect
  isSignificant: true,
  interpretation: "Statistically significant with moderate effect"
}
```

**Output in Reports**:
> Nike Brand Mention Score:
> - January 2025: 67% (CI: 62%-72%)
> - December 2024: 59% (CI: 54%-64%)
> - Change: +8 percentage points (p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.41)
> - **Interpretation**: Statistically significant moderate increase

### 4. Quality Gates ✅

**Implemented**: `validateResponse()` function

Every response passes through 4 gates:

| Gate | Criteria | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Word Count** | 50-500 words | Too short = incomplete, too long = unfocused |
| **Brand Mentions** | 3-15 brands | Too few = limited, too many = spam |
| **No Promotional** | No "buy now" language | Detects sponsored content |
| **Substantive** | Has reasoning keywords | Ensures depth, not fluff |

**Flagged responses** go to manual review queue.

### 5. Experimental Controls ✅

**Implemented**: `EXPERIMENTAL_CONTROLS` constant

| Control Variable | Value | Why Locked |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| **Temperature** | 0.7 | Consistent creativity level |
| **Max Tokens** | 1000 | Prevents response length bias |
| **System Prompt** | Fixed text | Eliminates instruction variation |
| **Model Versions** | Locked quarterly | Only update on schedule |
| **Run Window** | 48 hours | Temporal consistency |
| **Run Order** | Randomized | Eliminates position bias |

## 📈 Longitudinal Analysis Capabilities

### Monthly Delta Tracking
```typescript
{
  metric: "Nike Mention Share",
  baseline: 59% // Month 0
  month1: 61% // +2pp
  month2: 64% // +3pp  
  month3: 67% // +3pp
  trend: "Linear growth, r² = 0.97"
}
```

### Rolling Windows
- 3-month MA: Smooth seasonal noise
- 12-month comparison: Year-over-year growth
- Peak detection: Identify campaign effects

### Cohort Analysis
Track brands by entry date:
- Established (pre-2020)

## 🏆 Why This Framework Wins

### vs. Searchable's Approach
| Aspect | Searchable | Your Framework |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Prompts | Ad-hoc, unstructured | 20 per sector, version-controlled |
| Runs | 1 (no validation) | 2 (statistical stability) |
| Stats | None | Z-tests, Cohen's d, 95% CI |
| Reproducibility | Low | High |
| Board-ready | No | Yes |
| Defensible | Questionable | Audit-grade |

### vs. Generic Analytics
- ✅ **Not directional**: "Probably increased" → "Increased 7.8pp, p=0.018"
- ✅ **Not anecdotal**: "Seems popular" → "89% mention rate vs sector avg 34%"
- ✅ **Not subjective**: "Good reputation" → "Sentiment score 0.82, rank #3/78"

## 📐 Mathematical Rigor

### Two-Proportion Z-Test
```
H₀: p₁ = p₂ (no change in mention rate)
Hₐ: p₁ ≠ p₂ (significant change)

z = (p₁ - p₂) / √[p̂(1-p̂)(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]

Where:
p₁ = current month proportion
p₂ = previous month proportion  
p̂ = pooled proportion
n₁, n₂ = sample sizes

Reject H₀ if p < 0.05
```

### Effect Size (Cohen's d)
```
d = (p₁ - p₂) / σ_pooled

Interpretation:
d < 0.2: Trivial
0.2 ≤ d < 0.5: Small
0.5 ≤ d < 0.8: Moderate
d ≥ 0.8: Large
```

### Confidence Intervals
```
95% CI = (p₁ - p₂) ± 1.96 × SE

Where SE = √[p̂(1-p̂)(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)]
```
