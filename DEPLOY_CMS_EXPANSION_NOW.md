## 🔄 Optional: Update Frontend (Later)

The CMS content is now in your database, but your frontend still has hardcoded text.

**When you're ready to make frontend fetch from CMS:**

1. See: `CMS_EXPANSION_QUICK_START.md` → Section "STEP 3"
2. Update: `src/lib/cms/cms-client.ts` (add template helper)
3. Update: `src/app/leaderboards/page.tsx` (fetch from CMS)
4. Update: `src/app/reports/[sector]/page.tsx` (if exists)
5. Update: `src/app/dashboard/evaluation/[id]/page.tsx` (if exists)

**But this is optional!** The CMS is ready to use whenever you update the frontend.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Edit with Confidence

- ✅ Can always revert changes
- ✅ JSON validation prevents syntax errors
- ✅ Preview before publishing (if enabled)

### Common Edits
- **Alert messages**: Edit in <2 minutes
- **Pricing**: Update tiers anytime
- **Beta banner**: Toggle on/off instantly
- **Grade labels**: Refine descriptions

### Template Variables
Some text has `{placeholders}` like `{sector_name}`:
- ✅ Keep the curly braces
- ✅ Edit text around them
- ❌ Don't remove them (breaks dynamic content)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Pages not showing in CMS"
**Cause:** SQL didn't run completely  
**Fix:** Re-run the entire SQL file (it's safe to re-run)

### "Can't save block edits"
**Cause:** JSON syntax error  
**Fix:** Check for missing commas, quotes, or brackets

### "Changes not appearing on site"
**Cause:** Frontend not fetching from CMS yet  
**Fix:** Either:
- Update frontend (see Quick Start guide)
- Or: Content is in CMS, just not displayed yet (that's fine!)
