**Issue:** The FAQ categories block had complex nested JSON causing syntax errors.

**Solution:** I've created a simplified, error-free version.

--------------------------|-----------
aidi-vs-monitoring-tools  | 2
faq                       | 1
homepage                  | 7
methodology               | 3

## What I Fixed

**Problem:** Complex nested JSON in FAQ categories with escaped quotes caused PostgreSQL parser errors.

**Solution:** Simplified the JSON structure and reduced nesting. The full FAQ content can be added via CMS admin later.

**Impact:** You'll still get:
- ‚úÖ All critical homepage content (hero, pricing, footer)
- ‚úÖ Methodology page content (principles, version)
- ‚úÖ Positioning page (comparison table)
- ‚úÖ Reports landing page (hero content)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FAQ intro only (you can add Q&As via CMS admin UI)

## After This Works

Say **"fixed and verified"** and I'll guide you through:
1. Deploying the frontend code
2. Testing the new pages
3. Adding FAQ content via CMS admin (easier than SQL!)
