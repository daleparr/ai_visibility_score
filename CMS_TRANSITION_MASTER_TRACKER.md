## Risk Register

### High Risk Items

#### Risk 1: Database Migration Failures
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Status:** 🔴 Open

**Description:** SQL migration could fail due to schema conflicts or data integrity issues.

**Mitigation:**
- Always backup database before migration
- Test migration on local/staging first
- Have rollback script ready
- Review schema for conflicts before running

**Rollback Plan:**
```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM content_blocks WHERE created_at > '2025-10-16 00:00:00';
DELETE FROM cms_pages WHERE slug IN ('methodology', 'faq', 'aidi-vs-monitoring-tools');
-- Restore from backup if needed
ROLLBACK; -- or COMMIT if confirmed
```

---

#### Risk 2: Frontend Breaking Changes
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Status:** 🟡 Monitoring

**Description:** Converting from client to server components may break existing functionality.

**Mitigation:**
- Keep interactive parts in separate client components
- Use Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Add error boundaries for graceful failures
- Test thoroughly on staging before production

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
git log --oneline  # Find last stable commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
# Netlify auto-redeploys
```

---

#### Risk 3: Content Quality Issues
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Status:** 🟢 Monitored

**Description:** New authoritative copy may not resonate with current audience.

**Mitigation:**
- A/B test new copy vs. old copy (50/50 split)
- Monitor conversion rates closely
- Get stakeholder approval before deployment
- Easy to edit via CMS if needed

**Rollback Plan:**
- Edit CMS blocks back to consumer-friendly copy
- No code deployment needed (instant rollback)
