## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES (3 items)**

### **Issue 1: Pricing Tiers - toFixed Errors**
**Symptom:** Page loads but shows runtime error  
**Error:** `e.price_amount.toFixed is not a function`  
**Cause:** Not ALL toFixed calls wrapped with Number()  
**Fix Needed:** Find remaining instances and wrap them

### **Issue 2: Industry Report Toggles Don't Save**
**Symptom:** Click toggle, no state change  
**Cause:** Either:
- API endpoint `/api/admin/sectors/[id]` not working
- Or toggle not calling it correctly  
**Fix Needed:** Verify API exists and is called on toggle

### **Issue 3: Logos Not Visible on Frontend**
**Symptom:** Logos in CMS collections, but not showing on homepage/reports  
**Cause:** No frontend component fetching and rendering logo collections  
**Fix Needed:** Create `<LogoDisplay collection="homepage_trusted" />` component

---

## 🚀 **QUICK WINS (Can Fix in Next 30 min)**

### **Fix 1: Pricing Tiers toFixed**
Search all TierManager files for `.toFixed` and wrap with `Number()`

### **Fix 2: Industry Toggles**
Test if `/api/admin/sectors/[id]` exists and responds  
If not, it's already created - just needs to be deployed

### **Fix 3: Logo Frontend Display**
Create simple component:
```typescript
<LogoDisplay collectionKey="homepage_trusted" />
// Fetches from /api/logos/collection/{key}
// Renders logos in grayscale
```
