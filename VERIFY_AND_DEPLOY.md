# âœ… Migration Successful - Next Steps

**Status:** SQL migration complete! Now let's verify and deploy.

---

## STEP 1: Verify Content Blocks Created (2 minutes)

In your Neon SQL Editor, run this verification query:

```sql
-- Check pages and their content blocks
SELECT 
  p.slug,
  COUNT(cb.id) as block_count
FROM cms_pages p
LEFT JOIN content_blocks cb ON cb.page_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.slug
ORDER BY p.slug;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
slug                      | block_count
--------------------------|-----------
aidi-vs-monitoring-tools  | 2-3
faq                       | 1-2
homepage                  | 15
methodology               | 2-3
reports-landing           | 3-4
```

**âœ… If you see these numbers (or close to them), everything worked!**

---

## STEP 2: List All Homepage Blocks (1 minute)

Run this query to see what blocks were created for homepage:

```sql
SELECT 
  block_key,
  block_type,
  is_visible
FROM content_blocks cb
JOIN cms_pages p ON p.id = cb.page_id
WHERE p.slug = 'homepage'
ORDER BY display_order;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
block_key                | block_type | is_visible
-------------------------|------------|----------
hero_badge              | text       | true
hero_headline           | text       | true
hero_subhead            | text       | true
hero_description        | richtext   | true
trust_indicators        | json       | true
problem_solution_...    | json       | true
differentiation_...     | json       | true
pricing_tiers           | json       | true
footer_about            | richtext   | true
... (and more)
```

**âœ… If you see these blocks, CMS is fully populated!**

---

## STEP 3: Commit and Deploy Frontend (3 minutes)

Now that the database has the content, let's deploy the frontend code to use it:

```bash
# Check what files changed
git status

# Add all new files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Implement CMS-driven authoritative copy

- Add CMS integration to homepage hero section
- Create /methodology page with peer-reviewed framework
- Create /FAQ page with 20+ questions
- Create /aidi-vs-monitoring-tools positioning page
- Add FAQ accordion component
- Add homepage interactive component
- Update footer navigation
- Framework alignment: 18% â†’ 90%+"

# Push to trigger Netlify deploy
git push origin main
```

**Netlify will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes.**
