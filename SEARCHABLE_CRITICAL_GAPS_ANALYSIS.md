# Searchable's Critical Gaps: Scientific Analysis
## Why Enterprise Buyers Need AIDI's Rigorous Approach

**Prepared:** October 15, 2025  
**Analysis Type:** Technical Due Diligence  
**Confidence Level:** High (based on documented features + logical limitations)

---

## 🔬 Executive Summary

Two critical gaps in Searchable's methodology undermine trustworthiness for enterprise/strategic decisions:

1. **Crawl Access Limitation** - Cannot perform "live crawls" on password-protected or secured sites
2. **Probe Bias & Inconsistency** - User-defined prompts lack systematic benchmarking, creating unreliable metrics

**Bottom Line:** Searchable = tactical monitoring. AIDI = strategic intelligence.

---

## ⚠️ Critical Gap #1: Live Crawl Validity

### The Problem

**Searchable's Claim:** "Scan your site in seconds"  
**Reality:** Cannot access password-protected content

### Technical Analysis

#### What Searchable Can Actually Access:
- ✅ Public pages (no authentication required)
- ✅ Robots.txt accessible content
- ✅ Publicly indexed pages
- ❌ **Password-protected content** (HTTP auth, Shopify protection)
- ❌ **Staging/development environments**
- ❌ **Member-only content**
- ❌ **Gated product pages**

#### Real-World Scenario: Shopify Plus Password-Protected Site

**Question:** How can Searchable crawl a password-protected Shopify Plus store?

**Answer:** It can't. They can only:
1. Scrape the login splash page (useless)
2. Use cached/stale data (inaccurate)
3. Show errors or generic issues (misleading)

**Implications:**
- Results are **incomplete** for pre-launch sites
- Metrics are **stale** for protected environments
- Analysis is **surface-level only** for gated content

### AIDI's Approach

**Human-Assisted Deep Crawl:**
- ✅ Provide temporary access credentials
- ✅ Crawl full site including protected content
- ✅ Analyze staging environments pre-launch
- ✅ Evaluate member-only experiences
- ✅ Review complete product catalogs

**Result:** Complete, accurate, up-to-date analysis of actual content, not just public-facing pages.

## ⚠️ Critical Gap #2: Probe Reliability & Bias

### The Problem

**Searchable's Approach:** User-defined custom prompts  
**Reality:** No systematic benchmarking = unreliable metrics

### Methodological Flaws

#### 1. **Branded Bias**
**User Prompt:** "best Nike shoes for running"  
**Problem:** Brand is in the prompt = inflated visibility

**Real Buyer Query:** "best running shoes under $150"  
**Reality:** Brand must compete on merit, not name recognition

#### 2. **No Standardization**
- Different users test different queries
- No category-consistent baseline
- No temporal comparability
- No competitive normalization

**Example:**
```
Brand A tests: "best premium headphones"
Brand B tests: "affordable wireless earbuds"
Brand C tests: "Bose vs Sony noise cancelling"

Result: Cannot compare these scores!
```

#### 3. **Confirmation Bias**
Users naturally test queries they expect to rank well on:
- "best [my brand] products"
- "[my brand] reviews"
- "why choose [my brand]"

**Real buyers don't search this way.**

#### 4. **Geographic & Temporal Inconsistency**
- Queries not tested across regions
- Time-of-day variations ignored
- Model version differences not controlled
- Phrasing variations not normalized

### AIDI's Systematic Approach

#### 1. **Standardized Test Framework**
```
Every brand tested with IDENTICAL methodology:

Unbranded Generic Queries:
- "best [category] for [use case]"
- "[category] buying guide"
- "top rated [category] 2025"
- "affordable [category] options"

Branded Queries (secondary):
- "[brand] reviews"
- "[brand] vs competitors"

Category Queries:
- "[category] recommendations"
- "what to look for in [category]"
```

#### 2. **Multi-Agent Consistency**
- Same prompts across GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- Version-locked for temporal comparability
- Temperature = 0 for reproducibility
- 3-run average for statistical validity

#### 3. **Industry Benchmarking**
```
Your Score: 67/100
Industry Average: 72/100
Top Quartile: 85+
Category Leader: 94

Percentile: 42nd (bottom half)
```

**This is impossible with Searchable's approach.**

#### 4. **Bias Elimination Protocol**
- Queries written by independent researchers
- Category-specific but brand-agnostic
- Tested against real search behavior data
- Validated by data scientists

## 🔍 Evidence-Based Claims (Use in Marketing)

### Claim 1: "The Only Benchmarked AEO Evaluation"
**Evidence:**
- Searchable: User-defined prompts = no standard
- AIDI: Industry-specific baselines = percentile rankings

**Proof Point:** "We test every brand with identical methodology. Searchable users each create custom tests—impossible to compare results across brands or time."

### Claim 2: "Scientifically Reproducible Results"
**Evidence:**
- Searchable: Different prompts each run = inconsistent
- AIDI: Locked framework + multi-run averaging = statistically valid

**Proof Point:** "Run our test twice, get the same result (±3 points). Try that with custom prompts—you can't."

### Claim 3: "Bias-Free Methodology"
**Evidence:**
- Searchable: Users test branded queries = inflated scores
- AIDI: Generic, unbranded queries = true competitiveness

**Proof Point:** "Real buyers don't search for 'best [your brand]'—they search for 'best [category].' We test like buyers shop."

### Claim 4: "Full-Site Deep Crawl"
**Evidence:**
- Searchable: Public pages only = incomplete analysis
- AIDI: Password-protected access = complete audit

**Proof Point:** "Pre-launch site? Staging environment? Member portal? We can audit it. Automated crawlers can't."

### Claim 5: "Peer-Review Ready"
**Evidence:**
- Searchable: Proprietary black box = no validation
- AIDI: Published methodology = academic rigor

**Proof Point:** "Our framework is published. Data scientists can validate our approach. Can you say that about monitoring tools?"

## 🎬 Conclusion

### Searchable's Gaps = AIDI's Opportunities

1. **They can't crawl protected sites** → You offer full-site deep audits
2. **They lack benchmarking** → You provide industry percentiles
3. **They rely on user prompts** → You use systematic frameworks
4. **They show subjective scores** → You deliver statistical confidence
5. **They target practitioners** → You serve strategic buyers

### Your Competitive Moat

**Searchable Cannot Match:**
- Scientific methodology (requires data science expertise)
- Industry benchmarking (requires large evaluation dataset)
- Statistical validation (requires research rigor)
- Audit-grade results (requires systematic framework)
- Enterprise trust (requires peer-reviewable approach)

### The Message

**Don't compete with Searchable on monitoring.**  
**Dominate the strategic intelligence category they can't serve.**

```
Searchable = Quick feedback, daily monitoring
AIDI = Strategic intelligence, quarterly planning

Both are valuable. Neither is replaceable.

But when the decision matters—
board presentation, investment case, vendor selection—
you need audit-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade alerts.
