## 📣 Messaging Framework

### Tagline
> **"The Audit-Grade Standard for AEO Intelligence"**

### Positioning Statement
```
Searchable helps you monitor daily tactics.
AIDI helps you make strategic decisions.

While monitoring tools provide quick feedback with user-defined tests,
AIDI delivers audit-grade intelligence with scientific rigor:

✓ Full-site access (including password-protected content)
✓ Systematic benchmarking (industry percentiles, not isolated scores)
✓ Statistical validation (confidence intervals, not guesses)
✓ Bias-free methodology (unbranded queries, not branded prompts)
✓ Peer-reviewable results (published framework, not black box)

When the decision matters—board presentations, M&A due diligence,
vendor selection, performance attribution—you need audit-grade rigor.

AIDI: The data science approach to AEO intelligence.
```

### Key Message by Audience

#### **C-Suite Executives**
> "Would you base a $500K strategic investment on monitoring data? Or would you want audit-grade validation with industry benchmarks and statistical confidence?"

#### **Data Scientists**
> "Can you reproduce their results? Validate their methodology? Export raw data? Or do you need a framework built by data scientists, for data scientists?"

#### **Procurement**
> "Can you audit their approach? Compare vendors objectively? Defend this investment? Or do you need documented, peer-reviewable methodology with full audit trails?"
