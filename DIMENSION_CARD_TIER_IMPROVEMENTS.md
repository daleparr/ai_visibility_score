# Dimension Card Tier-Based Improvements

## üéØ Overview
Updated the dimension card dropdowns to remove clutter for free users while providing value-added information for paid tiers (Index Pro & Enterprise).

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **UserFriendlyDimensionCard Component** (`src/components/adi/reporting/UserFriendlyDimensionCard.tsx`)

#### Added User Tier Support
- Added `userTier` prop to component interface
- Type: `'free' | 'index-pro' | 'enterprise'`
- Default: `'free'`

#### Conditional Rendering Based on Tier

**Free Tier:**
- ‚ùå **REMOVED** "See how this affects AI conversations" dropdown
- ‚ùå **REMOVED** "Technical details" dropdown
- ‚úÖ Users still see:
  - Score and grade
  - Business question and impact
  - Current status indicator
  - Quick win recommendations (if score < 90)
  - Conversational copy breakdown (if applicable)

**Index Pro & Enterprise Tiers:**
- ‚úÖ **KEPT** "See how this affects AI conversations" dropdown
  - Shows dimension-specific before/after AI responses
  - Each dimension has unique, contextual examples
  - Examples demonstrate real business value
- ‚úÖ **KEPT** "Technical details" dropdown
  - Shows technical dimension name
  - Shows pillar classification
  - Shows technical description
  - Shows analysis evidence (if available)

### 2. **Evaluate Page Integration** (`src/app/evaluate/page.tsx`)

Updated the rendering of `UserFriendlyDimensionCard` components to pass the `userTier` prop:

```typescript
<UserFriendlyDimensionCard
  key={index}
  dimension={dimension}
  isConversationalCopy={dimension.name.toLowerCase().includes('conversational')}
  userTier={tier}  // ‚Üê NEW: Pass tier from URL params
/>
```

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Free Tier
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removed repetitive, low-value dropdowns
- **Faster Comprehension**: Focus on core metrics and actionable insights
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Less scrolling, more compact cards
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Free users get essential insights, paid tiers unlock deeper analysis

### Index Pro & Enterprise Tiers
- **Dimension-Specific AI Examples**: Each dimension shows unique before/after AI conversation examples
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Access to technical details for deeper understanding
- **Evidence-Based**: View analysis evidence for transparency
- **Professional Insights**: Contextual information that helps inform strategic decisions

## üìä Dimension-Specific AI Examples

The component leverages the existing `getAIInteractionExample()` function which provides unique examples for each dimension:

| Dimension | Before Example | After Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Geographic Visibility** | "I can find some stores but I'm not sure about current hours or exact locations." | "There are 3 stores near you. The Regent Street location is open until 8pm and has parking available." |
| **Citation Strength** | "I've heard of this brand but don't know much about their reputation." | "This brand has been featured in Vogue and Business Insider for their sustainable practices and quality." |
| **Schema & Structured Data** | "I can see they sell clothing but I'm not sure about prices or availability." | "The quilted bag is ¬£89, available in black and brown, and in stock for next-day delivery." |
| **Product Identification** | "They have various products but I'm not sure what they're known for." | "They're famous for their quilted bags, minimalist outerwear, and sustainable basics - especially the fisherman sweater." |

*And 8+ more dimension-specific examples...*
