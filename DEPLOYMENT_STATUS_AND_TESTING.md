# Deployment Status & Testing Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Timeline

### What Just Happened (Last 30 Minutes)

1. **09:58 UTC** - Railway workers deployed with `crawl_agent` fix (commit `9e8e1fb8`)
2. **~11:20 UTC** - Netlify frontend deployed with URL validation fixes (commit `c73738c1`)  
3. **~11:22 UTC** - Netlify frontend deployed with fallback logic fix (commit `0d797c53`)

---

## ✅ What's Now Deployed

### Railway Workers (Completed ✓)
- **Status**: ✅ LIVE
- **Deployment**: ~2 hours ago (triggered manually via `railway up`)
- **Critical Fix**: `crawl_agent` now mapped to scoring engine
- **Health**: Container running on port 3000
- **Logs**: Showing successful agent executions

### Netlify Frontend (Completed ✓)  
- **Status**: ✅ LIVE  
- **Deployment**: ~1 minute ago
- **Build Time**: 1:27 (1 minute 27 seconds)
- **Critical Fixes**:
  1. URL validation to prevent secrets masking during build
  2. Fallback to `statusData.results` when report has no dimensions

## 🧪 Testing Required

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The evaluation you're currently viewing is OLD

**Evaluation ID**: `ca4a6bdb-4168-4fec-b7d7-aa8c812c0c5e`  
**Started**: Before deployments completed  
**Problem**: Processed with OLD code (before fixes)

### ✅ How to Test the Fix

**Step 1: Clear Everything**
```
1. Close the current report page
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete → All time)
3. Open incognito window
4. Go to: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/
```

**Step 2: Run Fresh Evaluation**
```
1. Click "Start Free Evaluation"
2. Enter: nike.com
3. Select tier: Index Pro
4. Click "Analyze Now"
5. Wait ~2-3 minutes for completion
```

**Step 3: Verify the Fix**
Check for these indicators:

✅ **Dimension Cards at Top Should Show**:
```
🏗️ Infrastructure (expected: 50-70/100)
├─ Schema & Structured Data
├─ Semantic Clarity
├─ Knowledge Graphs
└─ LLM Readability

🧠 Perception (expected: 40-60/100)
├─ Geo Visibility
├─ AI Answer Quality  
├─ Citation Authority
└─ Reputation Signals

🛒 Commerce (expected: 30-50/100)
├─ Hero Products
└─ Policies & Logistics ← This dimension specifically tests crawl_agent
```

✅ **Console Logs Should Show**:
```javascript
🔍 DIMENSION SCORES DEBUG: {
  dimensionScoresLength: 9,        // ← Should be 9, not 0!
  firstDimension: { name: "...", score: XX },  // ← Should have data!
  allDimensionNames: [...9 names...],
  allDimensionScores: [...9 scores...]
}
```

✅ **Probe Results Should Show**:
- All 6 Railway agents completed
- Real scores (not all 50/100)
- Detailed evidence for each probe

---

## 🐛 If Still Showing 0/100 After Fresh Evaluation

### Debugging Checklist

**1. Check Console Logs**

Look for these specific logs in browser console:

```javascript
// Should show dimensions in status
statusDataResultsDimensions: 9   // ✅ Good - status has data

// Should fallback if report is empty  
⚠️ [Data] Report has no dimensions, falling back to status.results

// Should show final dimension count
dimensionScoresLength: 9   // ✅ Should be 9, not 0
```

**2. Check Netlify Deployment**

Verify latest deployment is live:
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-discoverability-index/deploys
- Latest deploy should show commit `0d797c53`
- Status should be "Published"

**3. Check Railway Logs**

For your evaluation ID, check Railway logs for:
```
🎯 [ScoringEngine] Extracted X dimension scores
💾 [Finalizer] Successfully saved X dimension scores
```

If it shows "0 dimension scores" or "No dimension scores to save", the scoring engine issue persists.

**4. Share These Logs**

If still broken, share:
- Full browser console log (expand all objects)
- Railway logs for the specific evaluation ID
- Netlify function logs for bridge-callback

## 📊 Expected vs Actual

### Before Fix
```
Dimension Cards: 0/100 (all cards)
Report Endpoint: dimensionScores = []
Status Endpoint: results.dimensionScores = [] 
Database: No records in dimension_scores table
```

### After Fix
```
Dimension Cards: Real scores (40-75/100 range)
Report Endpoint: dimensionScores = [] (still broken - needs database fix)
Status Endpoint: results.dimensionScores = [9 dimensions] ✅
Frontend: Falls back to status.results ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Next Session Tasks (If This Works)

Once dimension cards are working with the fallback:

1. **Fix the database save issue** - Make dimension scores persist to database
2. **Remove fallback logic** - Clean up once database saves work
3. **Add validation** - Ensure all agents are mapped before finalizing
4. **Clean up debug logs** - Remove excessive console logging

---

## 📝 Summary

**Current State**: Both Railway and Netlify are deployed with fixes

**Action Required**: Run a FRESH evaluation (not the old `ca4a6bdb-4168-4fec-b7d7-aa8c812c0c5e` one)

**Expected Outcome**: Dimension cards show real scores via fallback to status.results

**If It Works**: The scoring engine fix + frontend fallback solves the immediate UX issue

**If It Doesn't**: We need to debug why statusData.results doesn't have dimensions either

**Ready to test!** 🚀
