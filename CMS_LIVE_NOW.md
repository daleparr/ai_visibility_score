## ⚠️ If You Get "Unauthorized"

The CMS checks for authentication. Quick fix for testing:

**Option 1: Login First**
- Go to http://localhost:3005/auth/signin
- Login with your admin account
- Then access /admin/cms

**Option 2: Temporary Disable Auth (Testing Only)**
Comment out auth checks in API routes (we can re-enable later)
