## PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION

### Headline
```
AEO Monitoring vs AEO Benchmarking: What's the Difference?
```

### Two-Column Comparison

#### Column 1: Monitoring-Grade Tools
**Icon:** üìä  
**Title:** Monitoring-Grade Tools

**Description:**
```
Tools like Searchable excel at daily practitioner monitoring:

‚Ä¢ Quick feedback on changes
‚Ä¢ Tactical alert systems
‚Ä¢ User-customizable tests
‚Ä¢ Fast, ongoing tracking

Perfect for: Day-to-day optimization
Audience: SEO/marketing practitioners
Pricing: $99-999/month subscriptions
```

#### Column 2: Benchmark-Grade Intelligence
**Icon:** üî¨  
**Title:** Benchmark-Grade Intelligence

**Description:**
```
AIDI provides strategic benchmarking for executives:

‚Ä¢ Industry percentile rankings
‚Ä¢ Statistical validation (CI, p-values)
‚Ä¢ Peer-reviewed methodology
‚Ä¢ Audit-grade documentation

Perfect for: Board presentations, M&A, strategy
Audience: C-suite executives, data scientists
Pricing: $2,500-10,000 per strategic audit
```

### Conclusion Statement
```
Both are valuable. Neither is replaceable.

Use monitoring tools for daily tactics.
Use AIDI for quarterly strategic validation.

When the decision matters‚Äîboard presentations, M&A due diligence,
vendor selection‚Äîyou need benchmark-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade alerts.
