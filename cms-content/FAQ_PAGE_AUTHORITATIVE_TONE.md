## CATEGORY 1: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Q1: How is AIDI different from Searchable?
```
A: Great question! Searchable and AIDI serve complementary needs:

SEARCHABLE: Daily Practitioner Monitoring
• Quick feedback on changes
• User-customizable tests
• Tactical optimization focus
• Subscription pricing ($99-999/month)
• Perfect for: SEO teams, content marketers, agencies

AIDI: Strategic Benchmarking  
• Quarterly validation with statistical rigor
• Standardized, unbiased tests
• Industry percentile rankings
• Per-audit pricing ($2,500-10,000)
• Perfect for: Board presentations, M&A, executive strategy

Many customers use BOTH:
• Searchable for day-to-day monitoring
• AIDI for quarterly strategic validation

Think: Fitbit (Searchable) + Annual Bloodwork (AIDI).
Different purposes, both valuable.
```

### Q2: Can I use AIDI instead of Searchable?
```
A: You could, but we don't recommend it.

Searchable and AIDI are designed for different purposes:

SEARCHABLE = Best for daily monitoring
• Ongoing tracking
• Quick tactical alerts
• Practitioner workflows
• Content team feedback

AIDI = Best for strategic validation
• Quarterly benchmarking
• Executive decision-making  
• Board presentations
• M&A due diligence

Most mature AEO programs use BOTH:
• Searchable for execution layer (daily)
• AIDI for intelligence layer (quarterly)

They're complementary, not competitive.
```

### Q3: Do you compete with monitoring tools?
```
A: No. We complement them.

The AEO market needs both:

Monitoring Layer (Tools like Searchable):
→ Daily practitioner feedback
→ Tactical optimization
→ Affordable ongoing access

Benchmark Layer (AIDI):
→ Quarterly strategic validation
→ Executive confidence
→ Statistical rigor

As the AEO category matures—thanks to leaders like Searchable—
demand for both layers grows.

We're not competing for the same buyer or use case.
```

## CATEGORY 2: METHODOLOGY & RIGOR

### Q4: What do you mean by "audit-grade" rigor?
```
A: Audit-grade means results you can defend to boards, CFOs, and auditors:

✓ Reproducible
  Same test, same result (±3 points at 95% confidence)
  
✓ Statistically Validated
  Confidence intervals, p-values, effect sizes reported
  
✓ Benchmarked
  Industry percentiles, not isolated scores
  
✓ Peer-Reviewed
  Published methodology, third-party auditable
  
✓ Unbiased
  Standardized tests, no branded queries

Monitoring-grade tools provide quick feedback.
Audit-grade platforms provide defensible metrics.

When you're presenting to the board or evaluating an M&A target,
you need audit-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade estimates.
```

### Q5: What does "bias-free testing" mean?
```
A: Bias-free means your brand must earn mentions based on merit, not prompt engineering.

THE PROBLEM:
Many AEO tools let users create custom prompts like:
• "best [YOUR BRAND] products"
• "why choose [YOUR BRAND]"
• "[YOUR BRAND] reviews"

Your brand is IN the prompt! This creates false positives—
artificially inflated visibility scores that don't reflect real buyer behavior.

AIDI'S APPROACH:
We use generic, unbranded queries that reflect how buyers actually search:
• "best [category] for [use case]"
• "top rated [category] under $X"
• "[category] buying guide"

Your brand must earn the mention based on merit, not prompt engineering.

RESULT:
You get TRUE competitive positioning, not inflated scores.

Example:
Bad: "best Nike running shoes" ← Nike is in the prompt (biased)
Good: "best running shoes under $150" ← Brand must earn mention (unbiased)
```

### Q6: Why do you test across multiple AI models?
```
A: Different AI systems have different blind spots.

THE CHALLENGE:
Each AI model has:
• Different training data
• Different architectures
• Different retrieval mechanisms
• Different update frequencies

A brand might rank well on GPT-4 but poorly on Claude.

OUR APPROACH:
AIDI tests across 4+ leading models:
• GPT-4 (OpenAI)
• Claude-3-Sonnet (Anthropic)
• Gemini Pro (Google)
• Perplexity AI

Plus additional models (Enterprise tier):
• GPT-3.5-turbo
• Claude-3-Opus
• Mistral Large
• Llama 70B

RESULT:
You get comprehensive visibility, not single-model blind spots.

Your customers use all these models. Shouldn't your measurement?
```

### Q7: What are confidence intervals and why do they matter?
```
A: Confidence intervals tell you how reliable your score is.

WITHOUT CONFIDENCE INTERVALS:
"Your score: 67"
→ Is this reliable? Could it be 60? 75?
→ If you re-run the test, will you get 67 again?
→ Is improvement from 67 to 69 real or just noise?

You can't tell.

WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS:
"Your score: 67 (95% CI: 62-72, n=160)"
→ We are 95% confident the true score is between 62-72
→ Re-running the test will yield 64-70 (high reproducibility)
→ Improvement to 74+ is real, 69 is likely noise

WHY THIS MATTERS:
• Distinguish real improvements from random variance
• Prove ROI with statistical significance (p<0.05)
• Defend metrics to skeptical CFOs and boards
• Make data-driven decisions with confidence

All AIDI scores include 95% confidence intervals.
Monitoring tools often report single-run point estimates.
```

## CATEGORY 3: PRICING & VALUE

### Q8: Why is AIDI more expensive than monitoring tools?
```
A: Strategic pricing reflects strategic value.

MONITORING TOOLS: $99-999/month
Designed for:
• Ongoing access
• Practitioner budgets
• Tactical optimization
• Content team feedback

AIDI: $2,500-10,000 per audit
Designed for:
• Strategic decisions
• Executive budgets
• Board presentations
• M&A due diligence

VALUE CONTEXT:
• A $2,500 audit influences a $500K marketing investment → 0.5% of budget
• A $10,000 audit informs a $15M M&A decision → 0.07% of deal size
• A $5,000 audit prevents a $2M valuation mistake → 2.5X ROI

The pricing reflects the magnitude of decisions being made, not the cost of data collection.

Both price points are appropriate for their use cases.
```

### Q9: What's the ROI of an AIDI audit?
```
A: ROI comes from better strategic decisions, not tactical optimization.

TACTICAL ROI (Monitoring Tools):
• 5-10% improvement in AI mention rate
• Faster content optimization
• Better practitioner productivity

Strategic ROI (AIDI):
• Prevent $500K-5M bad marketing investments
• Identify $2M+ M&A valuation gaps
• Defend strategic decisions to boards/CFOs
• Prioritize optimization with confidence

REAL EXAMPLES:
1. PE Firm (Protected Site Audit: $10K)
   Found $2M in hidden AEO gaps during M&A diligence
   ROI: 200X ($2M / $10K)

2. Enterprise CMO (Full Audit: $2,500)
   Validated $750K AEO investment with statistical confidence
   CFO approved budget based on AIDI percentile data
   ROI: 300X ($750K investment saved from rejection)

3. Data Science Team (Quarterly Audits: $10K/year)
   Integrated AIDI data into BI dashboards
   Executives gained confidence in AI visibility metrics
   ROI: Immeasurable (organizational confidence)

Strategic decisions compound. Tactical optimizations don't.
```

### Q10: Should I start with Quick Scan ($499) or Full Audit ($2,500)?
```
A: Depends on your immediate need:

QUICK SCAN ($499) - Best For:
✓ Testing AIDI before committing
✓ Budget-conscious initial assessment
✓ Rapid baseline (2-day turnaround)
✓ Deciding if Full Audit is worth it

You Get:
• 4 core dimensions
• Basic benchmarking
• Upgrade recommendations
• 2-minute evaluation

FULL AUDIT ($2,500) - Best For:
✓ Board presentations
✓ Strategic planning
✓ Competitive intelligence
✓ Quarterly executive reviews

You Get:
• All 12 dimensions
• Industry percentile ranking
• Statistical confidence intervals
• Board-ready reporting
• 90-day action roadmap

OUR RECOMMENDATION:
• Start with Quick Scan if budget is tight
• Upgrade to Full Audit for strategic milestones
• Most customers do Quick Scan once, then Full Audits quarterly

Think: Quick Scan = Blood pressure check, Full Audit = Complete physical.
```

## CATEGORY 4: PROTECTED SITES & M&A

### Q11: Can you analyze password-protected or pre-launch sites?
```
A: Yes! This is a key differentiator.

THE PROBLEM:
Automated crawlers (including most monitoring tools) can only access public pages.

For password-protected Shopify stores, staging environments, or 
pre-launch sites, they're limited to:
• Surface scraping of public pages
• Cached data (often outdated)
• Login page analysis (not actual content)

AIDI'S SOLUTION: Human-Assisted Deep Audits
You provide temporary credentials (via secure form).
Our data scientists conduct complete site analysis—including:
• Staging environments
• Member portals
• Gated content
• Pre-launch pages
• Password-protected stores

CRITICAL FOR:
• Pre-launch AEO evaluation
• M&A due diligence (target sites are often protected)
• Staging environment testing
• Member-only experience analysis
• E-commerce sites under development

PRICING:
$5,000 Protected Site Audit
(Includes everything in Full Audit + human-assisted access)

SECURITY:
• Temporary credentials only
• Deleted after audit completion
• NDA signed before access
• Audit trail documented
```

### Q12: How does AIDI help with M&A due diligence?
```
A: We provide audit-grade documentation for diligence reports.

M&A DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Access protected sites (automated tools can't)
✓ Audit-grade documentation (defendable to investors)
✓ Statistical validation (not rough estimates)
✓ Competitive positioning (vs. industry benchmarks)
✓ Valuation impact analysis (revenue risk quantification)

AIDI M&A DUE DILIGENCE PACKAGE ($10K):
• Protected site access with temporary credentials
• Complete 12-dimension evaluation
• Industry percentile benchmarking
• Statistical confidence intervals
• Competitive analysis (5+ competitors)
• Executive presentation deck
• Diligence report documentation

REAL CASE STUDY:
Mid-market PE firm evaluating $15M Series B investment in DTC brand.
Target site was password-protected (pre-launch).

Automated tools: Could only analyze public landing page (incomplete)

AIDI audit: Revealed:
• 34th percentile in AI visibility (below industry average)
• $2M estimated gap to reach 60th percentile (industry median)
• 18-month optimization roadmap required

OUTCOME:
• Deal closed at $13M (revised valuation)
• $2M reserved for AEO optimization
• AIDI audit ROI: 200X ($2M / $10K)

No monitoring tool could have provided this analysis.
```

## CATEGORY 6: INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS

### Q15: How do you calculate industry benchmarks?
```
A: Rigorous statistical methodology with quality controls.

SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS:
• Minimum 50 brands per industry
• Quarterly updates
• Rolling 12-month dataset
• Outlier filtering (±3 SD)

PERCENTILE CALCULATION:
P = (L + 0.5F) / N × 100

Where:
L = brands below your score
F = brands at your score
N = total brands evaluated

STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
• Shapiro-Wilk normality test
• Winsorization for extreme outliers
• Confidence bands around percentiles
• Test-retest reliability (r > 0.90)

CURRENT COVERAGE:
✓ Fashion & Apparel (n=127)
✓ SaaS & Technology (n=98)
✓ E-commerce & DTC (n=156)
✓ Healthcare & Wellness (n=73)
✓ Financial Services (n=64)
✓ Travel & Hospitality (n=91)
✓ Consumer Electronics (n=82)
[+ 8 more industries]

TRANSPARENCY:
We publish sample sizes, update frequencies, and methodology.
No black box benchmarking.
```

### Q16: What if my industry isn't covered yet?
```
A: We'll still provide a comprehensive audit, with caveats.

WITHOUT INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS:
✓ You still get complete 12-dimension evaluation
✓ You still get statistical validation (CI, p-values)
✓ You still get actionable recommendations
✗ You won't get industry percentile rankings

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
1. Cross-Industry Benchmarking
   We'll compare you to "all industries" baseline
   (Less precise, but still useful context)

2. Custom Competitor Benchmarking
   We'll evaluate 5+ competitors you specify
   Then rank you within that custom peer group

3. Wait for Industry Coverage
   We're adding 2-3 industries per quarter
   Request your industry → We'll prioritize

PRICING:
No penalty for missing industry benchmarks.
You still get full audit at standard pricing.
