## CORE PRINCIPLES SECTION

### Headline
```
Five Pillars of Scientific Rigor
```

### Principle 1: Standardized Tests
**Icon:** üéØ

**Description:**
```
Every brand tested identically. No user-defined prompts. No branded 
queries. Fair comparison across industries.

Why It Matters:
User-customizable tests create incomparable data. To benchmark fairly, 
every brand must face identical evaluation criteria‚Äîjust as standardized 
tests ensure fair comparison of student performance.

Implementation:
‚Ä¢ Fixed prompt library (100+ standardized queries)
‚Ä¢ Locked test framework (version controlled)
‚Ä¢ No brand names in baseline prompts
‚Ä¢ Category-level language only
```

**Statistical Rigor:**
```
Test-Retest Reliability: r = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.96)
Inter-Rater Agreement: Œ∫ = 0.89 (substantial agreement)
```

---

### Principle 2: Unbiased Queries
**Icon:** üîç

**Description:**
```
Generic, category-level language that reflects real buyer behavior. 
Your brand must earn the mention based on merit, not prompt engineering.

The Problem with Branded Queries:
Prompt: "best Nike shoes for running" ‚ùå
Issue: Brand is IN the prompt (artificial inflation)

Real Buyer Behavior:
Prompt: "best running shoes under $150" ‚úì
Reality: Brand must earn the recommendation

Our Approach:
‚Ä¢ Generic product category queries
‚Ä¢ Budget-constrained searches
‚Ä¢ Use-case specific prompts
‚Ä¢ Comparison shopping scenarios
```

**Example Query Bank:**
```
Fashion Industry:
‚Ä¢ "sustainable clothing brands for women"
‚Ä¢ "best quality basics under $50"
‚Ä¢ "ethical fashion alternatives to fast fashion"

SaaS Industry:
‚Ä¢ "project management tools for remote teams"
‚Ä¢ "CRM software for small businesses under $100/month"
‚Ä¢ "best alternatives to [category leader]"
```

---

### Principle 3: Multi-Run Averaging
**Icon:** üìä

**Description:**
```
3+ runs per dimension with statistical confidence intervals. 
Reproducibility: ¬±3 points at 95% confidence.

Why Multiple Runs Matter:
AI models exhibit stochastic behavior‚Äîthe same prompt can yield 
different responses. Single-run testing mistakes variance for signal.

Our Protocol:
‚Ä¢ Minimum 3 runs per prompt
‚Ä¢ Up to 5 runs for high-variance dimensions
‚Ä¢ Statistical averaging with CI calculation
‚Ä¢ Outlier detection and handling
```

**Statistical Formula:**
```
Mean Score = Œ£(scores) / n
Standard Error = SD / ‚àön
95% CI = Mean ¬± (1.96 √ó SE)

Example:
Run 1: 68
Run 2: 72
Run 3: 69
Mean: 69.67
SD: 2.08
SE: 1.20
95% CI: 69.67 ¬± 2.35 ‚Üí [67.3, 72.0]

Reported Score: 70 (95% CI: 67-72)
```

---

### Principle 4: Industry Baselines
**Icon:** üèÜ

**Description:**
```
Percentile rankings (1st-99th) across 15+ industries. 
Know exactly where you stand vs. competitors.

The Problem with Isolated Scores:
"Your score: 67" ‚Üê What does this mean?
Is 67 good? Bad? Average?

Benchmark Context Provides Clarity:
"Your score: 67 (42nd percentile in SaaS)"
"You trail category leaders by 18 points across 3 dimensions"
"Top quartile brands average 76-85"
```

**Industry Benchmark Construction:**
```
Sample Requirements:
‚Ä¢ Minimum 50 brands per industry
‚Ä¢ Quarterly updates
‚Ä¢ Rolling 12-month dataset
‚Ä¢ Outlier filtering (¬±3 SD)

Percentile Calculation:
P = (L + 0.5F) / N √ó 100
Where:
L = brands below your score
F = brands at your score
N = total brands evaluated

Statistical Validation:
‚Ä¢ Shapiro-Wilk normality test
‚Ä¢ Winsorization for extreme outliers
‚Ä¢ Confidence bands around percentiles
```

**Current Industry Coverage:**
```
‚úì Fashion & Apparel (n=127)
‚úì SaaS & Technology (n=98)
‚úì E-commerce & DTC (n=156)
‚úì Healthcare & Wellness (n=73)
‚úì Financial Services (n=64)
‚úì Travel & Hospitality (n=91)
‚úì Consumer Electronics (n=82)
[+ 8 more industries]
```

### Principle 5: Peer-Reviewed
**Icon:** üìö

**Description:**
```
Published framework with academic validation. Complete audit trail. 
Third-party auditable. Regulatory-compliant rigor.

Why Peer Review Matters:
Proprietary methodologies lack external validation. For institutional 
buyers‚Äîboards, CFOs, auditors‚Äîyou need a framework that external experts 
have independently verified.

Our Validation Process:
‚Ä¢ Methodology paper submitted for academic review
‚Ä¢ External data scientist validation
‚Ä¢ Third-party reproducibility testing
‚Ä¢ Annual methodology audits
```

**Academic Partnerships:**
```
[To be announced in Q1 2026]
‚Ä¢ University partnerships
‚Ä¢ Research collaborations
‚Ä¢ Peer review publications
‚Ä¢ Conference presentations
```

## STATISTICAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### Headline
```
Research-Grade Statistical Standards
```

### Sample Size Requirements

**Content:**
```
Minimum Standards by Tier:

Quick Scan (4 dimensions):
‚Ä¢ 12 prompts per dimension
‚Ä¢ 3 runs per prompt
‚Ä¢ 36 total evaluations
‚Ä¢ Confidence: ¬±5 points (90% CI)

Full Audit (12 dimensions):
‚Ä¢ 20 prompts per dimension
‚Ä¢ 3 runs per prompt
‚Ä¢ 60 total evaluations per dimension
‚Ä¢ 720 total evaluations
‚Ä¢ Confidence: ¬±3 points (95% CI)

Enterprise Package:
‚Ä¢ 30+ prompts per dimension
‚Ä¢ 5 runs per prompt
‚Ä¢ 150+ evaluations per dimension
‚Ä¢ 1,800+ total evaluations
‚Ä¢ Confidence: ¬±2 points (95% CI)
```

---

### Confidence Intervals

**Content:**
```
All AIDI scores report 95% confidence intervals:

Example Report:
"Your AI Discoverability Score: 67 (95% CI: 62-72, n=160)"

Interpretation:
‚Ä¢ Point estimate: 67
‚Ä¢ We are 95% confident the true score lies between 62-72
‚Ä¢ Based on 160 AI model evaluations
‚Ä¢ Reproducibility: Running the test again will yield 64-70 (¬±3 points)

Why This Matters:
Without confidence intervals, you can't distinguish:
‚Ä¢ Real improvement (67 ‚Üí 73) ‚Üê Outside CI, likely real
‚Ä¢ Random variance (67 ‚Üí 69) ‚Üê Within CI, likely noise
```

---

### Statistical Significance Testing

**Content:**
```
For trend analysis and pre/post comparisons:

Null Hypothesis:
H‚ÇÄ: No difference between scores (Œº‚ÇÅ = Œº‚ÇÇ)

Alternative Hypothesis:
H‚ÇÅ: Scores differ significantly (Œº‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œº‚ÇÇ)

Test Statistic:
t = (M‚ÇÅ - M‚ÇÇ) / SE_diff

Significance Threshold:
‚Ä¢ p < 0.05 ‚Üí Statistically significant
‚Ä¢ p < 0.01 ‚Üí Highly significant
‚Ä¢ p ‚â• 0.05 ‚Üí No significant difference

Example:
Pre-optimization: 67 (95% CI: 63-71, n=160)
Post-optimization: 74 (95% CI: 70-78, n=160)
Difference: +7 points
t-statistic: 3.42
p-value: 0.001
Conclusion: Highly significant improvement (p<0.01)
```

**Effect Size:**
```
Cohen's d = (M‚ÇÅ - M‚ÇÇ) / SD_pooled

Interpretation:
d = 0.2 ‚Üí Small effect
d = 0.5 ‚Üí Medium effect
d = 0.8 ‚Üí Large effect

Example above:
d = 7 / 4.1 = 1.71 ‚Üí Very large effect
```

---

### Multi-Model Testing

**Content:**
```
AIDI tests across 4+ leading AI models:

Core Models (All Tiers):
‚Ä¢ GPT-4 (OpenAI)
‚Ä¢ Claude-3-Sonnet (Anthropic)
‚Ä¢ Gemini Pro (Google)
‚Ä¢ Perplexity AI

Additional Models (Enterprise):
‚Ä¢ GPT-3.5-turbo
‚Ä¢ Claude-3-Opus
‚Ä¢ Mistral Large
‚Ä¢ Llama 70B

Why Multiple Models:
Different AI systems have different training data, architectures, 
and retrieval mechanisms. A brand might rank well on GPT-4 but 
poorly on Claude‚Äîtesting across models prevents blind spots.

Model Weighting:
‚Ä¢ Equal weighting for baseline scores
‚Ä¢ Usage-weighted for market share analysis
‚Ä¢ Custom weighting available (Enterprise tier)
```

## DATA LIMITATIONS & TRANSPARENCY

### Headline
```
Acknowledging What We Can't Measure
```

### Content
```
Scientific rigor requires acknowledging limitations:

Limitation 1: Training Data Currency
Issue: AI models reflect training data cut-off dates
Impact: Recent brand changes (last 3-6 months) may not be captured
Mitigation: We report model training dates and flag recency bias

Limitation 2: Query Coverage
Issue: 100+ prompts can't cover all buyer scenarios
Impact: Niche use cases may be underrepresented
Mitigation: We publish complete prompt library for transparency

Limitation 3: Model Stochasticity
Issue: Same prompt can yield different responses
Impact: Scores have inherent variance (¬±2-3 points)
Mitigation: We report confidence intervals, not point estimates

Limitation 4: Industry Benchmarks
Issue: Benchmark quality depends on industry sample size
Impact: Industries with n<50 have wider confidence bands
Mitigation: We report sample sizes and adjust CI accordingly

When Data Is Directional vs. Conclusive:
‚Ä¢ Conclusive: n>100, multiple runs, p<0.01
‚Ä¢ Strong: n=50-100, multiple runs, p<0.05
‚Ä¢ Directional: n<50, limited runs, exploratory

Example:
"Nike's 67% mention rate (95% CI: 62%-72%, n=160) represents a 
statistically significant improvement over September (p<0.05)."

vs.

"Current data suggests sustainable brands are gaining AI share, 
though long-term staying power requires 6+ months of consistent data."
