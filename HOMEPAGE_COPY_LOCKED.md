  <conclusion>
    <strong>Both are valuable. Neither is replaceable.</strong>
    
    Use monitoring tools for daily tactics.
    Use AIDI for quarterly strategic validation.
    
    When the decision matters—board presentations, M&A due diligence,
    vendor selection—you need benchmark-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade alerts.

  <headline>Why Systematic Benchmarking Matters</headline>
  
  <problem>
    <title>The Problem with User-Defined Prompts</title>
    
    User prompt: "best Nike shoes for running"
    Problem: Brand is IN the prompt! ← Artificial inflation
    
    Real buyer: "best running shoes under $150"  
    Reality: Brand must earn the mention ← True competitiveness
    
    Result: User-defined prompts create false positives and 
    incomparable metrics across brands.

  <solution>
    <title>AIDI's Systematic Framework</title>
    
    <principles>
      1. Standardized Tests
         → Every brand tested identically
         → Fair comparison across industries
      
      2. Unbiased Queries
         → Generic, category-level language
         → No brand names in baseline prompts
      
      3. Multi-Run Averaging
         → 3+ runs per dimension
         → Statistical confidence intervals
      
      4. Industry Baselines
         → Percentile rankings (1st-99th)
         → Know exactly where you stand
      
      5. Peer-Reviewed

## 🤝 "About Searchable" Section (Gracious Positioning)

```html
<section class="about-category">
  <headline>The Rise of AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)</headline>
  
  <intro>
    Thanks to innovators like Searchable and Chris Donnelly, brands are 
    waking up to the importance of AI visibility. Their reach and momentum 
    are educating the market about Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)—the 
    practice of optimizing for AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, 
    Claude, and Perplexity.
  </intro>
  
  <market-evolution>
    <title>From Awareness to Measurement</title>
    
    <stage>
      <number>1</number>
      <title>Category Creation</title>
      <leader>Searchable</leader>
      <focus>Market education, awareness, community building</focus>

      <focus>Scientific measurement, strategic validation, industry standards</focus>
    </stage>
  </market-evolution>
  
  <positioning>
    AIDI doesn't compete with monitoring tools.
    We complement them with systematic benchmarking.
    
    As the AEO market matures—driven by leaders like Searchable—
    demand for audit-grade measurement standards grows.
    
    That's where AIDI comes in: the benchmark standard for enterprises 
    that need results they can defend to boards, present to CFOs, and 
    rely on for strategic investment.
  </positioning>

## ❓ FAQ Section

```html
<section class="faq">
  <question>How is AIDI different from Searchable?</question>
  <answer>
    Great question! Searchable and AIDI serve complementary needs:
    
    <comparison>
      SEARCHABLE: Daily Monitoring
      • Quick feedback on changes
      • Practitioner-level insights
      • User-customizable tests
      • Excellent for: Tactical optimization
      
      AIDI: Strategic Benchmarking  
      • Quarterly validation
      • Executive-level intelligence
      • Systematic, reproducible tests
      • Excellent for: Board presentations, M&A, strategy
    </comparison>
    
    Many customers use BOTH:
    • Searchable for day-to-day monitoring
    • AIDI for quarterly strategic validation
    
    Think: Fitbit (Searchable) + Annual Bloodwork (AIDI).
    Different purposes, both valuable.
  </answer>
  
  <question>Can you analyze password-protected or pre-launch sites?</question>
  <answer>
    Yes! This is a key differentiator.
    
    Automated crawlers (including Searchable) can only access public pages.
    For password-protected Shopify stores, staging environments, or 
    pre-launch sites, they're limited to surface scraping or cached data.
    
    AIDI offers HUMAN-ASSISTED DEEP AUDITS where you provide temporary 
    credentials (via secure form) and our data scientists conduct complete 
    site analysis—including staging, member portals, and gated content.
    
    This is critical for:
    • Pre-launch AEO evaluation
    • M&A due diligence (target sites are often protected)
    • Staging environment testing
    • Member-only experience analysis
    
    Pricing: $5,000 Protected Site Audit
  </answer>
  
  <question>What do you mean by "bias-free testing"?</question>
  <answer>
    Many AEO tools let users create custom prompts like:
    • "best [YOUR BRAND] products"
    • "why choose [YOUR BRAND]"
    • "[YOUR BRAND] reviews"
    
    Problem: Your brand is IN the prompt! This creates false positives—
    artificially inflated visibility scores that don't reflect real buyer 
    behavior.
    
    AIDI uses generic, unbranded queries that reflect how buyers actually 
    search:
    • "best [category] for [use case]"
    • "top rated [category] under $X"
    • "[category] buying guide"
    
    Your brand must earn the mention based on merit, not prompt engineering.
    
    This gives you TRUE competitive positioning, not inflated scores.
  </answer>
  
  <question>What's "audit-grade" rigor?</question>
  <answer>
    Audit-grade means results you can defend to boards, CFOs, and auditors:
    
    ✓ Reproducible: Same test, same result (±3 points)
    ✓ Validated: Statistical confidence intervals and p-values
    ✓ Benchmarked: Industry percentiles, not isolated scores
    ✓ Documented: Complete audit trail, peer-reviewable methodology
    ✓ Unbiased: Controls for branded queries and user preferences
    
    Monitoring-grade tools provide quick feedback.
    Audit-grade platforms provide defensible metrics.
    
    When you're presenting to the board or evaluating an M&A target,
    you need audit-grade rigor, not monitoring-grade estimates.
  </answer>
  
  <question>Can I use AIDI instead of Searchable?</question>
  <answer>
    You could, but we don't recommend it.
    
    Searchable and AIDI are designed for different purposes:
    
    SEARCHABLE = Best for daily monitoring
    • Ongoing tracking
    • Quick tactical alerts
    • Practitioner workflows
    
    AIDI = Best for strategic validation
    • Quarterly benchmarking
    • Executive decision-making  
    • Board presentations
    
    Most mature AEO programs use BOTH:
    • Searchable for execution layer (daily)
    • AIDI for intelligence layer (quarterly)
    
    They're complementary, not competitive.
