# Leaderboard Data Strategy Implementation Guide

**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Goal:** Replace mock leaderboard data with real ADI evaluations  

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the leaderboard data strategy, transforming the feature from mock data to authentic competitive intelligence powered by real ADI evaluations.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### New Components Created

1. **Database Schema Extensions** ([`drizzle/0001_leaderboard_data_system.sql`](drizzle/0001_leaderboard_data_system.sql))
   - `evaluation_queue` - Manages systematic brand evaluations
   - `leaderboard_cache` - Stores real evaluation results with rankings
   - `competitive_triggers` - Handles user-triggered competitor evaluations
   - `niche_brand_selection` - Systematic brand selection per niche
   - `leaderboard_stats` - Analytics and performance metrics

2. **Leaderboard Population Service** ([`src/lib/leaderboard-population-service.ts`](src/lib/leaderboard-population-service.ts))
   - Queue management for batch evaluations
   - Real ADI evaluation integration
   - Ranking calculation and caching
   - Competitive trigger handling

3. **API Endpoints**
   - [`/api/leaderboard-population`](src/app/api/leaderboard-population/route.ts) - Management interface
   - Updated [`/api/leaderboards`](src/app/api/leaderboards/route.ts) - Real data integration

4. **Management Scripts**
   - [`scripts/seed-leaderboard-brands.ts`](scripts/seed-leaderboard-brands.ts) - Initialize brand selections
   - [`scripts/process-leaderboard-queue.ts`](scripts/process-leaderboard-queue.ts) - Process evaluation queue

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration

```bash
# Apply the new database schema
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

**What this does:**
- Creates 5 new tables for the leaderboard data system
- Adds indexes for optimal query performance
- Sets up foreign key relationships

### Step 2: Initialize Brand Selections

```bash
# Populate brand selections for all niches
npm run leaderboard:seed
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes the brand taxonomy (25+ niches)
- Selects 20 brands per niche for systematic evaluation
- Populates the `niche_brand_selection` table
- Creates ~500 brand evaluation targets

### Step 3: Start Evaluation Processing

```bash
# Begin processing the evaluation queue
npm run leaderboard:process
```

**What this does:**
- Processes 5 brands simultaneously (configurable)
- Executes real ADI evaluations using the orchestrator
- Caches results in `leaderboard_cache` table
- Updates rankings (global, sector, industry, niche)

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check queue statistics
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/leaderboard-population?action=stats"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "pending": 485,
    "running": 5,
    "completed": 10,
    "failed": 0,
    "totalToday": 15
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Verify Real Data Integration

```bash
# Test leaderboard with real data
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/leaderboards?type=niche&category=Streetwear"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Returns real evaluation data when available
- Falls back to generated data for unpopulated niches
- Shows authentic ADI scores and rankings

## 📊 Configuration Options

### Evaluation Queue Settings

```typescript
const config = {
  batchSize: 5,        // Concurrent evaluations
  dailyLimit: 20,      // Maximum evaluations per day
  retryAttempts: 3,    // Retry failed evaluations
  cacheExpiryDays: 30, // Cache validity period
  intervalMinutes: 30  // Time between batches
}
```

### Priority System

1. **Priority 1-2:** User-triggered competitor evaluations
2. **Priority 3-5:** Market leaders in each niche
3. **Priority 6-10:** Emerging and geographic mix brands
4. **Priority 11+:** Price coverage and niche completion

---

## 🔄 Operational Workflows

### Daily Operations

1. **Morning Queue Processing**
   ```bash
   npm run leaderboard:process
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   ```bash
   curl "localhost:3000/api/leaderboard-population?action=stats"
   ```

3. **Cache Cleanup** (Weekly)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "localhost:3000/api/leaderboard-population" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "cleanup_cache"}'
   ```

### Competitive Intelligence Workflow

When users add competitors:

1. **Automatic Detection**
   - System detects new competitor URLs
   - Creates competitive trigger record
   - Adds to evaluation queue with high priority

2. **Real-time Evaluation**
   - Processes competitor within 30 minutes
   - Updates leaderboard rankings
   - Notifies user of completion

3. **Federated Learning Enhancement**
   - New evaluation data improves model accuracy
   - Enhances peer group detection
   - Strengthens competitive insights

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Queue Not Processing**
```bash
# Check queue status
curl "localhost:3000/api/leaderboard-population?action=stats"

# Restart processing
curl -X POST "localhost:3000/api/leaderboard-population" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "process_queue"}'
```

**2. High Failure Rate**
- Check ADI orchestrator configuration
- Verify website accessibility
- Review error messages in queue table
- Adjust retry limits and timeouts

**3. Stale Cache Data**
- Monitor cache expiry dates
- Run cleanup operations
- Check evaluation frequency
- Verify ranking update logic

**4. Missing Real Data**
- Confirm niche brand selection populated
- Check evaluation queue processing
- Verify cache table population
- Review API fallback logic

### Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check queue status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM evaluation_queue GROUP BY status;

-- View recent cache entries
SELECT niche_category, brand_name, adi_score, last_evaluated 
FROM leaderboard_cache 
ORDER BY last_evaluated DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check ranking distribution
SELECT niche_category, COUNT(*) as brand_count, AVG(adi_score) as avg_score
FROM leaderboard_cache 
GROUP BY niche_category 
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;

-- Monitor competitive triggers
SELECT trigger_type, evaluation_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM competitive_triggers 
GROUP BY trigger_type, evaluation_status;
```
