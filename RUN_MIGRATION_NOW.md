### Method B: Command Line (If you prefer terminal)

```bash
# Set the database URL (replace with your actual URL)
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgres://your-connection-string-here"

# Run migration
psql $env:DATABASE_URL -f sql/cms-content-authoritative-tone-migration.sql

# Verify
psql $env:DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT slug, COUNT(*) as blocks FROM cms_pages p LEFT JOIN content_blocks cb ON cb.page_id = p.id GROUP BY slug ORDER BY slug;"
```

---

## STEP 3: Verify Migration Worked (3 minutes)

### Run This Query in Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check pages created
SELECT slug, title, status FROM cms_pages ORDER BY slug;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
slug                      | title                              | status
--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------
aidi-vs-monitoring-tools  | AIDI vs. Monitoring Tools         | published
faq                       | Frequently Asked Questions        | published
homepage                  | Homepage                          | published
methodology               | AIDI Methodology: Peer-Reviewed   | published
reports-landing           | Industry Reports                  | published
```

### Check Content Blocks:

```sql
-- Count blocks per page
SELECT 
  p.slug,
  COUNT(cb.id) as block_count
FROM cms_pages p
LEFT JOIN content_blocks cb ON cb.page_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.slug
ORDER BY p.slug;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
slug                      | block_count
--------------------------|------------
aidi-vs-monitoring-tools  | 2-3
faq                       | 2
homepage                  | 15
methodology               | 3-5
reports-landing           | 4
```

âœ… **If you see these results, migration was successful!**

---

## STEP 4: Test CMS Admin (5 minutes)

1. **Access CMS:**
   - Local: http://localhost:3005/admin/cms
   - Production: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/admin/cms

2. **Browse Content:**
   - Click **Page Content** in sidebar
   - Click **Homepage**
   - You should see blocks: hero_headline, hero_subhead, etc.

3. **Test Editing:**
   - Click **Edit** on "hero_headline"
   - Change text to: "TEST - Migration Successful"
   - Click **Save**
   - Verify it saved

4. **Revert Test:**
   - Edit again
   - Change back to: "The Benchmark Standard for AEO Intelligence"
   - Save

âœ… **If you can edit and save, CMS is working!**

## âœ… Success Criteria

You've succeeded if:
- [ ] SQL migration ran without errors
- [ ] 5 pages exist in cms_pages table
- [ ] ~30 content blocks exist in content_blocks table
- [ ] CMS admin shows all pages
- [ ] You can edit and save a block

---

## ðŸš¨ If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Syntax error near line X"
**Fix:** Copy the SQL file again carefully (might have copy/paste issue)

### Error: "Table does not exist"
**Fix:** Run `sql/cms-schema.sql` first (creates tables)

### Error: "Cannot connect to database"
**Fix:** Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

### CMS Admin Shows No Pages
**Fix:** Migration didn't run successfully - check SQL output for errors

## Next Steps After Migration

Once migration is successful:
1. âœ… I'll update the homepage to fetch from CMS
2. âœ… I'll build and test locally
3. âœ… We'll deploy to production
4. âœ… You'll have fully functional CMS with authoritative copy

Say "migration complete" when you're done and I'll proceed to the next steps.
