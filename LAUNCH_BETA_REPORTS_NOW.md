# 🚀 Launch Beta Industry Reports NOW - Step by Step

## ✅ You Have 195 Evaluations - Ready to Launch!

With 195 completed leaderboard evaluations, you can launch beta industry reports **today**.

---

## 🎯 3-Step Launch Process

### STEP 1: Run Database Bridge (5 minutes)

**In Neon SQL Editor**, run the entire file:
📄 `sql/bridge-leaderboard-to-industry-reports.sql`

This will:
1. ✅ Create niche-to-sector mapping table
2. ✅ Map your 26 niches → 11 sectors
3. ✅ Add `industry_sector_id` column to `leaderboard_cache`
4. ✅ Sync 195 evaluations → `brand_performance` table
5. ✅ Show you which sectors have enough data

**Expected output**:
```
sector_name              | brands | max_rank | avg_sentiment
-------------------------+--------+----------+--------------
Fashion & Apparel        |     67 |       67 |          0.75
Beauty & Personal Care   |     38 |       38 |          0.75
Consumer Electronics...  |     29 |       29 |          0.75
Health & Wellness        |     22 |       22 |          0.75
...
```

### STEP 2: Generate Beta Reports (1 minute)

**Sign in to your site as admin**, then run:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/api/industry-reports/generate-from-cache \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

**OR** visit in browser:
```
https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/admin/industry-reports
```
Then click **"Generate Beta Reports from Leaderboard Data"** button (I'll add this)

This will:
1. ✅ Find sectors with 10+ brands
2. ✅ Generate industry reports with leaderboards
3. ✅ Mark as "Beta - AIDI Score Based"
4. ✅ Auto-publish to `/reports/[sector]`

### STEP 3: Test & Launch (10 minutes)

Visit your reports:
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/fashion
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/beauty
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/tech
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/wellness

**You should see**:
- ✅ Real brand names (Nike, Adidas, etc.)

- ✅ Beta methodology note
