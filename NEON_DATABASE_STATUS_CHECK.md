## 🚀 What Happens Now (No More SQL Needed)

### 1. Code is Deployed ✅
The latest push is deploying now. Once complete:

### 2. Admin Page Will Work
Visit: https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/admin/industry-reports

**You should see**:
- 11 sector cards
- "Generate Beta Reports" button
- System status

### 3. Click Button to Generate Reports
The button will:
1. Query `brand_performance` table (already populated!)
2. Generate reports for sectors with 10+ brands
3. Create entries in `industry_reports` table
4. Publish them

### 4. View Live Reports
Visit any sector:
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/fashion
- https://ai-discoverability-index.netlify.app/reports/beauty
- etc.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### DO NOT Re-Run These SQL Files:
- ❌ `add-sector-and-competitors-to-evaluations.sql` (already done)
- ❌ `bridge-leaderboard-to-industry-reports.sql` (already done)

They use `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ON CONFLICT` so they're safe, but unnecessary.

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Wait for current deployment to finish (~2 min)
2. ✅ Visit /admin/industry-reports
3. ✅ Click "Generate Beta Reports" button
4. ✅ View live reports

## 📊 Expected Report Data

From your bridge results, you should have brand performance data for several sectors.

**To verify**, run in Neon:
```sql
SELECT 
  s.name as sector_name,
  COUNT(*) as brands
FROM brand_performance bp
JOIN industry_sectors s ON bp.sector_id = s.id
WHERE bp.report_month = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
  AND bp.metadata->>'beta' = 'true'
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY brands DESC;
```

This will show you which sectors have data ready for reports.

---

## ✅ Database Status: PRODUCTION READY

**No more SQL changes needed. Everything is set up.**

**Next action**: Wait for deployment, then click the button in admin! 🚀
