# Local Development Server Debug Report

## Issue Summary
**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Severity**: High (Development Environment Blocking)

## Problem Description
The local Next.js development server was failing with webpack module resolution errors, preventing local development and testing.

### Error Symptoms
```
⨯ Error: Cannot find module './638.js'
⨯ Error: Cannot find module './329.js'
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next\fallback-build-manifest.json'
```

### Impact
- Local development server returning "Internal Server Error"
- Unable to test changes locally
- Webpack chunks failing to load despite existing in filesystem
- Missing build manifest files

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: Checked server response and error patterns
2. **File System Verification**: Confirmed missing chunks actually existed in `.next/server/chunks/`
3. **Build Cache Analysis**: Identified corrupted webpack runtime and missing manifests
4. **Git State Review**: Ruled out git conflicts as primary cause

### Root Cause Identified
**Primary Issue**: **Corrupted Next.js build cache**
- The `.next` directory contained stale webpack chunks and inconsistent build manifests
- Webpack runtime was attempting to load chunks with incorrect path references
- Missing fallback build manifest prevented error recovery

**Contributing Factors**:
- Previous build interruptions or incomplete builds
- Potential conflicts from recent dependency updates
- Stale cache state after multiple development sessions

## Solution Applied

### Step-by-Step Resolution
1. **Process Cleanup**
   ```bash
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   ```
   - Terminated all Node.js processes to clear memory locks

2. **Cache Clearing**
   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q .next
   npm cache clean --force
   ```
   - Completely removed corrupted build directory
   - Cleared npm cache for clean dependency state

3. **Fresh Build**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3005
   ```
   - Restarted development server with clean build cache

### Verification
- ✅ Server compilation successful (487 modules in 3s)
- ✅ Full HTML response with complete page content
- ✅ No webpack module resolution errors
- ✅ Fast subsequent builds (400ms)

## Results

### Before Fix
```
Status: Internal Server Error
Errors: Missing webpack chunks, corrupted manifests
Performance: Non-functional
```

### After Fix
```
Status: ✅ Fully Functional
Compilation: ✓ 487 modules in 3s
Performance: ✓ 400ms subsequent builds
Response: ✓ Complete HTML with all assets
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Immediate Actions
1. **Regular Cache Clearing**: Implement periodic `.next` directory cleanup
2. **Graceful Shutdowns**: Always stop dev server properly before system shutdown
3. **Dependency Management**: Clear cache after major dependency updates

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Build Scripts**: Add npm scripts for cache management
2. **Development Workflow**: Document proper dev server lifecycle
3. **Monitoring**: Implement build health checks

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS
- **Next.js**: 14 with App Router
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Files Affected
- `.next/` directory (completely regenerated)
- `npm cache` (cleared and rebuilt)
- No source code changes required

### Performance Metrics
- **Initial Build**: 3 seconds (487 modules)
- **Hot Reload**: 400ms average
- **Memory Usage**: Normal levels
- **CPU Usage**: Optimal

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build Cache Corruption**: Next.js build cache can become corrupted, especially after interrupted builds
2. **Diagnostic Approach**: Always verify file existence before assuming missing dependencies
3. **Clean State Recovery**: Complete cache clearing is often more effective than partial fixes
4. **Process Management**: Proper process cleanup prevents file locks and corruption

## Next Steps
1. Continue with production environment configuration
2. Test live database features once `DEMO_MODE=false` is set
3. Validate end-to-end functionality in production
4. Monitor production deployment performance
