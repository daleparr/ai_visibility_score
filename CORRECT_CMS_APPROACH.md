# ✅ Correct CMS Approach - All Content in content_blocks

**You were right!** All content should go through the CMS system.

---

## ❌ Wrong Approach (What I Was Doing)

```
Blog Posts → blog_posts table (direct SQL)
Job Postings → job_postings table (direct SQL)

Problem: Can't edit via CMS admin UI
```

---

## ✅ Correct Approach (Fixed Now)

```
Blog Posts → content_blocks table (as JSON)
Job Postings → content_blocks table (as JSON)

Benefit: Editable via /admin/cms interface
```

---

## How It Works Now

### CMS Architecture:
```
ALL CONTENT → content_blocks table
├── Homepage content
├── Methodology content
├── FAQ content
├── Blog posts (JSON array)
└── Job postings (JSON array)

EDIT VIA: /admin/cms → Page Content → [Page Name]
```

### Blog Example:
```
Page: blog
Block: blog_posts
Type: JSON
Content: {
  "posts": [
    {
      "title": "Why Benchmark-Grade...",
      "content": "...",
      "featured": true
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Careers Example:
```
Page: careers
Block: job_postings
Type: JSON
Content: {
  "positions": [
    {
      "title": "Senior Data Scientist",
      "salary_range": "$140-180K",
      "requirements": [...]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run the SQL (2 minutes)

**File:** `sql/cms-blog-and-careers-content-blocks.sql`

**In Neon SQL Editor:**
1. Copy entire file
2. Paste into SQL Editor
3. Click "Run"
4. Creates blog and careers content blocks

**Expected:**
- blog page: 3 blocks (title, description, blog_posts)
- careers page: 3 blocks (title, description, job_postings)

---

### Step 2: Wait for Deploy (2 minutes - Current)

**Status:** Deploying frontend updates  
**What Changed:** Blog and careers now fetch from CMS content_blocks

**When Netlify shows "Published":**
- Blog will render posts from CMS
- Careers will render positions from CMS

---

### Step 3: Test (1 minute)

**After deploy + SQL:**
- Visit /blog → Should show 3 posts
- Visit /careers → Should show 4 positions
- Both editable via /admin/cms

---
