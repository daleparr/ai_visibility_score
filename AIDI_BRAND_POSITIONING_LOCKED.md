# AIDI Brand Positioning - LOCKED
## The Benchmark Standard for AEO Intelligence

**Approved:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** üîí LOCKED - Use this positioning consistently across all materials  
**Review:** Quarterly (or when market shifts significantly)

---

## üéØ Core Positioning Statement

### The One-Liner
> **"The Benchmark Standard for AEO Intelligence"**

### The Strategic Position
```
Searchable creates the category.
AIDI sets the standard.

They lead on visibility and market education.
We lead on rigor and benchmark credibility.

They prepare the market.
We serve the market's most demanding buyers.
```

---

## üì£ Master Messaging Framework

### Primary Positioning (Use Everywhere)

**Against Searchable:**
```
Searchable lets users run custom, often brand-focused prompts to check 
AI visibility, but this approach is methodologically weak. Results depend 
on who asks, what they ask, and when‚Äînot on how real consumers discover 
brands.

Branded queries artificially inflate visibility, creating a false sense 
of AI discoverability (false positives). Worse, Searchable cannot truly 
crawl password-protected, pre-launch, or gated content‚Äîit relies on 
surface scraping or cached data. For protected sites, AI results may be 
outdated or entirely hallucinated by LLMs, not based on your real content. 
This makes Searchable's monitoring fast but fundamentally unreliable for 
enterprise or board-level trust.

AIDI solves these issues with audit-grade rigor:

‚úì Standardized, bias-controlled tests (not user-defined prompts)
‚úì Industry benchmarking (not isolated scores)  
‚úì Statistical validation (not single-run guesses)

‚úì HUMAN-ASSISTED DEEP CRAWL for protected sites‚Äî
  provide temporary credentials and our data scientists analyze your 
  complete site including staging environments, member portals, and 
  pre-launch content.

This delivers results executives can actually rely on for strategic 
decisions: board presentations, M&A due diligence, and pre-launch planning.

### Public Stance on Searchable

**Use this language in all public communications:**

```
"We're grateful to Chris Donnelly and the Searchable team for their 
leadership in raising awareness about Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). 
Their reach, funding, and momentum are preparing the market and educating 
brands about the importance of AI visibility.

Searchable is ideal for the category creator role‚Äîthey're paving the way 
and building market understanding.

AIDI follows as the benchmark standard: systematic, auditable, and 
statistically defensible measurement for brands that need results they 
can present to boards, defend to CFOs, and rely on for strategic investment.

We see Searchable and AIDI as complementary:
‚Ä¢ Searchable for market education and practitioner monitoring
‚Ä¢ AIDI for strategic benchmarking and executive decision-making

Both are essential for mature AEO programs."
```

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Attack Searchable publicly
- ‚ùå Position as direct competitors
- ‚ùå Claim they're "wrong" or "bad"
- ‚ùå Try to steal their SMB customers

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge their category leadership
- ‚úÖ Thank them for market education
- ‚úÖ Position as complementary/sequential
- ‚úÖ Serve different buying centers

**AIDI:** Industry percentiles (know where you stand)

**Why it matters:** Strategic positioning, investment decisions, vendor selection

---

### 3. Statistical Validation
**Searchable:** Single-run testing (variance unknown)  
**AIDI:** Multi-run averaging with confidence intervals

**Why it matters:** Prove improvements, performance attribution, ROI justification

---

### 4. Protected Site Analysis
**Searchable:** Surface crawling only (public pages)  
**AIDI:** Human-assisted deep audit (full site with credentials)

**Why it matters:** Pre-launch evaluation, M&A due diligence, staging environments

---

### 5. Audit-Grade Documentation
**Searchable:** Proprietary black box

## üí∞ Pricing Philosophy

### Searchable's Model (Estimated)
```
$99-999/mo - SaaS subscription
Target: Daily monitoring for practitioners
Value: Quick feedback, tactical alerts
```

### AIDI's Model (Locked)
```
$2,500 - Full Audit (core offering)
$5,000 - Protected Site Audit (with credentials)
$10,000 - Enterprise Package (pre-launch + M&A)

### Pricing Justification
**Not competing on price. Competing on rigor.**

```
Analogy:

Searchable = Fitbit ($99/mo)
‚Ä¢ Daily health monitoring
‚Ä¢ Quick feedback
‚Ä¢ Consumer-grade accuracy
‚Ä¢ Self-interpreted data

AIDI = Medical Lab Test ($2,500)
‚Ä¢ Strategic health decisions
‚Ä¢ Clinical accuracy
‚Ä¢ Doctor-grade results
‚Ä¢ Actionable diagnosis

You use both, but for different purposes.
When the decision matters, you need clinical-grade rigor.

## üé¨ Sales Scripts

### When Prospect Uses Searchable

**Opening:**
> "That's great! Searchable is excellent for daily monitoring. Many of 
> our customers use both tools."

**Positioning:**
> "Think of it this way: Searchable gives you quick feedback on what's 
> changing day-to-day. AIDI provides the quarterly benchmark validation 
> you need for strategic planning.
> 
> It's like using a Fitbit for daily tracking and getting annual 
> bloodwork for strategic health decisions. You need both, but for 
> different purposes."

**Close:**
> "Most executives use Searchable for practitioner-level monitoring and 
> AIDI for board-level planning. Would quarterly benchmark validation 
> be valuable for your strategic decisions?"

---

### When Prospect Asks "Why More Expensive?"

**Response:**
> "Searchable is priced for daily monitoring‚Äîexcellent value for 
> practitioner-level feedback.
>
> AIDI is priced for strategic intelligence‚Äîthe rigor you need when 
> presenting to boards, evaluating M&A targets, or justifying major 
> investments.
>
> Question: Would you base a $500K strategic initiative on $299/month 
> monitoring data? Or would you want audit-grade validation with industry 
> benchmarks and statistical confidence first?
>
> Different purposes, different rigor, different pricing."

---

### When Prospect Says "What's Wrong With User Prompts?"

**Response:**
> "Nothing‚Äîfor learning and exploration! But for strategic benchmarking, 
> user-defined prompts create three problems:
>
> **Problem 1: Branded Bias**
> User: 'best Nike shoes' ‚Üê Brand is IN the prompt!
> Reality: Buyers search 'best running shoes under $150' ‚Üê Brand must earn it
>
> **Problem 2: Incomparable Results**  
> Brand A tests 'premium headphones', Brand B tests 'affordable earbuds'
> ‚Üí Cannot compare these scores!
>
> **Problem 3: Confirmation Bias**
> Users test queries they expect to rank well on.
> Real buyers search very differently.
>
> **AIDI's Solution:** Every brand tested identically. Fair comparison, 
> reproducible results, unbiased benchmarks. That's why boards trust it."
